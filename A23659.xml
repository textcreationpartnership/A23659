            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>THere hath I confeſs been ſo much already written about the Doctrine of Juſtification, as may probably incline ſome to think the publication of theſe Papers to be ſuperfluous. But when it ſhall be conſidered how much of what hath been written on this ſubject, hath been done in a way of Controverſie about ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branches of the Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how little to ſtate and explain the whole of it, and yet how neceſſary this is for the ending of ſuch Controverſies;
<pb facs="tcp:56474:3"/>it's poſſible they may be of another mind. Some Chriſtians when they find in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures that ſometimes we are ſaid to be juſtified by the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and by his <hi>Obedience</hi> to be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; at another time that we are juſtified by <hi>Faith,</hi> at another that we are juſtified <hi>freely by Grace,</hi> at another that we are not juſtified by Faith only, but by <hi>Works</hi> alſo, and at another time that it is <hi>God</hi> that juſtifieth, they become ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in their own minds with this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of things to which our Juſtification is attributed. And although all ſuch as are well minded, may be the Goſpel in which theſe things are revealed, come ſo to believe, and ſo live as to be juſtified: yet many of them are at a great loſs how to underſtand in what reſpect we are ſaid to be juſtified by the one and by the other of theſe. And for want of a right ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and explaining how and in what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpects theſe ſeverals do concur to the producing one and the ſame effect, which is our Juſtification; ſome have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them, and attributed that to one of theſe cauſes, which is proper to another.
<pb facs="tcp:56474:3"/>As for inſtance, this hath been done when they have aſcribed to Chriſt, to his Blood, and to his Obedience and Righteouſneſs, not only what is proper to theſe, but alſo what is proper to Faith it ſelf; and ſo have drowned the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Faith as neceſſary to Juſtification, in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; whereas theſe are diſtinct in themſelves, and in the nature and manner of their operation; and the perſonal Righteouſneſs by Faith as really neceſſary to our Juſtification in one reſpect, as the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, his Blood, and his obedience, is in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, though in a way indeed ſubordinate to, and dependent upon this.</p>
            <p>Some good men have indeed thought they could not attribute too much to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in reference to our Juſtification (and in ſome ſenſe perhaps we cannot) and that it derogates from it, and from Free Grace, to intereſs our own perſonal Righteouſneſs by Faith therein at all; as if to do ſo did imply or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Righteouſneſs not ſufficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were eked out by ours, as they are wont to ſpeak. When as the queſtion is
<pb facs="tcp:56474:4"/>not about the ſufficiency of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Saviour for all thoſe ends to which the Father and himſelf have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it; but the queſtion is, whether it were deſigned by them to juſtifie any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their rebel ſtate, or before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, and become reconciled to God in mind and heart: and doubtleſs there is great reaſon to ſay it was not; ſince to juſtifie the wicked is an abomination to the Lord; and ſince alſo the actual col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all ſaving benefits upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſts Mediatory performance, is ſuſpended upon our being reconciled to God by obedience of Faith, which is our perſonal Righteouſneſs; as is ſhewed in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>It is a great miſtake to think that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt and our perſonal Righteouſneſs of Faith, ſtand in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one another, as if what is aſcribed to the later were taken from the former. Whereas our perſonal Righteouſneſs of Faith, is ſo far ſubſervient to the end and deſign of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as that his Righteouſneſs loſeth its end upon men for which it was deſigned, until
<pb facs="tcp:56474:4"/>they become perſonally Evangelically righteous. For the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt was never deſigned for the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Pardon, or Salvation of men, without perſonal righteouſneſs, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith. If we did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that to our perſonal righteouſneſs of Faith, which is proper only to the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial and meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, we ſhould indeed ſet the one in oppoſition to the other; which we are far enough from doing. But ſo long as our perſonal Righteouſneſs of Faith doth but ſerve under the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto our Juſtification, it no more eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the glory of it, than the ſhining of the Moon doth the glory of the Sun, when it borrows its light from it. But how theſe two Righteouſneſſes do differ, and yet concur to our Juſtification, you will ſee further in the Tractate it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nor does it at all derogate from the Grace of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to ſay our perſonal Righteouſneſs of Faith is one ingredient in our Juſtification, or that it is that without which we are not qualified for it; but that contrarily it
<pb facs="tcp:56474:5"/>doth illuſtriouſly ſet forth the Grace of God in being ſo. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe its being imputed or counted to us for righteouſneſs, and their being rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned righteous that have it, is altogether of grace and favour; for it does not of it ſelf make a man righteous according to the original law of ſtrict juſtice. It is therefore another great miſtake to oppoſe the Grace of God to our perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by Faith, in reference to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: When as it is the very act of grace it ſelf to reckon or impute Faith to us for Righteouſneſs, inſtead of a perfect legal righteouſneſs, upon account of Chriſts mediatory performance. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is therefore of Faith that it might be by Grace.</hi> It is ſpoken ſo as if it could not have been by Grace, unleſs it had been by Faith: <hi>Grace reigns through righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So very far is it from derogating from Grace to intereſs our perſonal righteouſneſs of Faith, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in our Juſtification. We are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified freely by Grace, and yet we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith alſo. And if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb facs="tcp:56474:5"/>thus joyns them together in the ſame work, though in different reſpects, we ſhall not do well I think to ſeparate them, much leſs to oppoſe them to one another in it. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved through faith,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place. It does not leſſen Grace at all that Faith is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in the ſame work under Grace in the ſalvation of men: For Grace ſhews it ſelf as well in ordaining Faith to be a righteouſneſs entitling a man to life, as it does in conferring life upon him that hath that righteouſneſs, being otherwiſe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: So that we can no more truly ſay that we are not juſtified by a perſonal righteouſneſs of Faith, becauſe we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Grace, and by Chriſt; than we can ſay a man is not born again of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible ſeed of the Word, becauſe he is born of God.</p>
            <p>To ſay as many have been wont to ſay, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> renounced his own perſonal inherent Righteouſneſs from having any thing to do in his Juſtification, becauſe he ſaid that he deſired to be found in Chriſt, not having his own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, is ſo far from proving that
<pb facs="tcp:56474:6"/>he did ſo, as that the contrary is plainly his ſcope and intent in the place where thoſe words of his are found. It was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his <hi>own</hi> Righteouſneſs which was <hi>by the Law,</hi> and which he truſted in while he was a Phariſee, which he here renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when he became a Chriſtian. Which Righteouſneſs is elſewhere called the Jews <hi>own</hi> Righteouſneſs, which they went about to eſtabliſh, as being ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of God. Which Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theirs, and of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> while a Phariſee, ſtood in an opinion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; Firſt, that the legal Sacrifices, the Blood of Bulls and of Goats, did of themſelves expiate and take away ſin, and that there was no need of the Blood of Chriſt to do it. Secondly, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Righteouſneſs without an internal, was all that was neceſſary to their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the circumciſion of the fleſh, and in the letter, without that which is of the heart, and in the ſpirit. Thirdly, in an opinion, that, for God to approve of them, and to juſtifie them as righteous upon this account, was but a due debt, not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of meer grace and favour. Now Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
<pb facs="tcp:56474:6"/>by the righteouſneſs of the Law in this ſenſe, this Apoſtle does indeed not only here renounce in himſelf, but alſo every where in his Epiſtles diſputeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as any matter of mens juſtification before God. And when he became a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, he deſired no longer to be found in this righteouſneſs which was of the Law, but to be found in Chriſt, as having that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith. The which Righteouſneſs of Faith is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to this Righteouſneſs which was of the Law, and does ſummarily conſiſt in a firm belief and practice of thoſe things which are contrary to thoſe in which the Phariſaical Righteouſneſs which was of the Law, did conſiſt. As firſt, in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that the Blood of Chriſt only does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate ſin. Secondly, in inward purity of heart by Faith as well as external Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Thirdly, in a hearty perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that it is meerly of grace and favour, that God through Chriſt will accept this for righteouſneſs, and that pardon of ſin and eternal life are promiſed upon this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition. And this is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb facs="tcp:56474:7"/>of Faith which this Apoſtle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in his Epiſtles to the other Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law, as the Righteouſneſs by which men ſhall be juſtified, and in which he himſelf deſired to be found. And this Righteouſneſs of Faith is ſaid to be of God, not only for that it is of his working in us, but alſo, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, becauſe it is of his meer grace and favour to ordain by the Goſpel, that this ſhall be reckoned to us for Righteouſneſs, and that we ſhall be approved of as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous if it be found in us, and dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as righteous, not only in not being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as ſinners, but on the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded as righteous. The other Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> while a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and other Phariſaical Jews expected to be juſtified, is ſaid to be their <hi>own</hi> Righteouſneſs; not only becauſe what it did conſiſt of was wholly within their own power to perform, without any ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſiſtance, but alſo and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the true Righteouſneſs only in their own opinion, and of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but never of Gods appointing or ordaining.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:56474:7"/>
            <p>When ſome good men heretofore did exclude all perſonal Righteouſneſs of Faith from having any hand in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, for fear they ſhould otherwiſe detract from the fulneſs and ſufficiency of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they little conſidered what a door they thereby opened for Libertiniſm to enter in among us, as after experience ſhewed they did. For many from that Doctrine thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo righteous in the ſight of God, by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them upon a ſpeculative Faith, as that they needed no other Righteouſneſs, and thought it a diſparagement to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt for any to ſay they did. They would at firſt pretend indeed that the ſenſe of Chriſts love, would in a way of gratitude produce a good life, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred it ſhould be made neceſſary to our Juſtification. This I my ſelf had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of above forty years ago, which with their neglect of Chriſtian Duties, firſt brought me under ſuſpicion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto Juſtification, otherwiſe than in the bleſſed effects of it.
<pb facs="tcp:56474:8"/>At that time the preſſing the neceſſity of Repentance, Mortification, and a ſincere keeping of the Commandments of God, begun to be called Legal preaching, as the like is ſtill counted but Moral preaching by ſome others. After this the foreſaid notion was improved to the breaking out of the groſſeſt <hi>Antinomian</hi> and <hi>Ranting</hi> practices, under pretence of magnifying Free Grace; to the great diſhonour of the Chriſtian profeſſion, and the apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of mens Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the obſervation of all which ſome worthy men were ſtirred up to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter by writing, not only ſuch abuſes and miſcarriages of men, but alſo thoſe Doctrines out of which they ſprang. In which they were oppoſed by ſome patrons of unſound Principles, which hath ſince oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned many Diſputes about ſome points in the Doctrine of Juſtification. In which Diſputes many School-nicities have been agitated, which the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans little underſtand, and which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves meddle not in. By means whereof ſuch have been puzled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than edified by much of what of this
<pb facs="tcp:56474:8"/>nature hath been done; whoſe edification yet, they being by far the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ought to be endeavoured as well at leaſt, if not rather, than the edification and ſatisfaction of thoſe of more refined apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>All which things conſidered, ſome more diſcourſes than have been yet extant, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtate and explain from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the whole buſineſs of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to level it to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtians of ordinary capacities, without incumbring it with diſputable queſtions, and arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> ſeems to me no more than in ſome ſort is needful.</p>
            <p>It happens in reference to the Doctrine of Juſtification, as it doth with many dark providences of God in the world: they are dark and obſcure, and to us ſeem unaccountable, becauſe we do not ſee from the beginning to the end of them, but only a part, which otherwiſe would appear lovely and beautiful, as effects of a moſt wiſe contrivance for excellent ends. Even ſo the Doctrine of Juſtification, while handled and beheld only in this or
<pb facs="tcp:56474:9"/>that particular part of it, remains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively obſcure: But when all which goes to the making up of the whole is put together in order, and when it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered how one thing depends upon, and anſwers another in it, it will not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult at all to underſtand it. And when the whole of Gods deſign in that way and method by which our Juſtification is brought about, is laid open, thoſe things in it which have been apprehended by ſome not well to conſiſt together, but to bear hard upon one another, will appear quite otherwiſe. For then the grace of God, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Righteouſneſs of him that is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, will appear, not in oppoſition, but in a lovely conjunction, all operating in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects to the ſame end.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe of theſe things hath I confeſs inclined me to offer at ſomething of this nature in the enſuing diſcourſe by way of eſſay. Wherein I have endeavoured with what plainneſs I could, to ſtate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature and cauſes of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and to ſhew how the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, the Covenant of Grace,
<pb facs="tcp:56474:9"/>Faith, and God himſelf, do both ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and joyntly operate to our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and how the grace of God is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in all. And likewiſe to ſhew, how that all that goes to our Juſtification, is by the Grace of God founded on the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, and immediately or remotely receives the vertue and efficacy of its operation from it, in conjunction with Gods gracious ordination. And particularly, that out of this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and the Grace of God thereby, doth ariſe the Covenant of Grace; and from that Covenant, the conſtitution of Faith for Righteouſneſs; and from that conſtitution, Gods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch for righteous, which have that Faith, and his adjudging them to be ſo. For which cauſe our Bleſſed Saviour may well be ſaid, as he is, to be made to us of God, Righteouſneſs. Theſe things will more fully appear in the diſcourſe it ſelf now before you, to which I refer you for your more full ſatisfaction. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the uſefulneſs of what is thereby deſigned and endeavoured, will ſo far appear, as to ſtir up and engage
<pb facs="tcp:56474:10"/>ſome others to undertake the ſame work, who may much better go through with it, and compleat it, than I have been able to do.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the ſignification and uſe of the word</hi> Juſtification; <hi>with a deſcription of Juſtification it ſelf.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE deſign of the following diſcourſe, is to ſtate the great Doctrin of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and ſo to repreſent it from the Holy Scriptures, as that it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted and fitted to the capacity of the meaneſt Chriſtian that is inquiſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a matter of that grand importance, as his <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God is. And as a guide herein, I ſhall firſt enquire
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56474:11"/>into the <hi>Notation</hi> and ſignification of the word, <hi>Juſtification.</hi> For the uſe of words being to convey to the mind the Idea and notion of things and the nature of them; it is but reaſonable to govern our ſelves in our notion of the nature of Juſtification, by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of ſuch words and phraſes, by which it is in Scripture expreſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this is done, I ſhall enquire into the ſeverals which <hi>operate</hi> to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this great effect, <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and how they do it. By all which, I hope, any Chriſtian of a very ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſhall be able to diſcern the true nature of juſtification, what it is and in what it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Juſtification</hi> in Scripture, ſignifies either to <hi>make juſt,</hi> or to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as juſt,</hi> or <hi>vindicate and adjudge as juſt</hi> or righteous. The word is but ſparingly uſed in Scripture as ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make juſt, but another word more commonly, which is Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But to be made juſt is eſſentially or abſolutely neceſſary to juſtification, as we ſhall ſee afterward: For God
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56474:11"/>will not approve of or adjudge any man as juſt who is not ſo. But about the more ordinary and common ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word, I find that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are much of one mind and do conclude, that the word, generally in Scripture is uſed in a <hi>forenſick</hi> or law ſenſe, and does imply a legal proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in a Cauſe or with a perſon, by a Judge, and according to ſome law. So the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. And ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Tho. Gataker</hi> (to name no more) in the Aſſemblies Annotations on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.23. which I ſhall give you in his own words. <hi>To juſtifie,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not to pardon as ſome would expound it, in the doctrine of the Goſpel: for the word is never found ſo uſed, either in the Hebrew or Greekwriters, Sacred, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, nor in our common ſpeech. Nor as it is a law-term doth it ever ſignifie to make juſt. But to juſtifie in a legal way, doth always ſignifie to defend, or to deem as juſt and guiltleſs, free from the offence wherewith the party called in queſtion is charged. To defend as juſt, and ſo it is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56474:12"/>the office of an Advocate: to deem as juſt and conſequently aſſoil from guilt, and ſo it is the part of a Judge. As alſo in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate carriages, men are ſaid to juſtifie others when they plead for them and avow their integrity and honeſty againſt thoſe that queſtion it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to this uſual ſenſe and notion of the word when applied to God as Judge in juſtifying of men, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his approbation of ſuch as are juſt in their Cauſe that is before him, to be ſo; his adjudging them to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the ſenſe of that Lawby which they are tried. Thus for inſtance, we have it in <hi>King.</hi> 8.31, 32. <hi>If any man treſpaſs againſt his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cauſe him to ſwear, and the oath come before the altar in this houſe: then hear thou in heaven and do, and judge thy ſervants concerning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and juſtifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteouſneſs.</hi> Where to juſtifie the righteous, does not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to make them righteous, but to appear for them in Judgment as thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56474:12"/>that are ſo, and to determine for them accordingly. To juſtifie the wicked, in Scripture-phraſe, does not ſignifie to make them juſt, but to approve of them and appear for them, as if they were juſt. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.23. And thus again (to give ſome inſtances in the New Teſtament) S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.4. Where to be juſtified, and to have God to judge for him, ſignifies the ſame. So likewiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Not the hearers of the law are juſt before God, but the doers of the law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> The meaning whereof is, that not the hearers but the doers of the law, ſhall be approved of by God as juſt. So that to be juſtified by God and to be approved of by him as juſt, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, is all one. <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her children,</hi> that is, approved of and defended againſt the accuſations and quarrels of her adverſaries. <hi>Lu.</hi> 7.29. The Publican <hi>went down to his houſe juſtified,</hi> that is, approved, rather
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56474:13"/>than the Phariſee. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified,</hi> that is, approved of by God as a good and righteous man, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>and not by faith only,</hi> Jam. 2.24. <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> By theſe as well as by other things perſons are and will be adjudged by God to be good and righteous, or wicked and ungodly men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.37. Again <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> Where Gods approbation of his people, is oppoſed to others diſapprobation of them; he approves of them as good, while their adverſaries condemn them as bad: they charge them as bad, but God abſolves and diſchargeth them as good. And in this judicial ſenſe is the word juſtification generally taken throughout the Scripture. By Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication men are conſtituted and made evangelically righteous: but in Juſtification they are approved of by God as ſuch, and adjudged to be ſo: which is the proper difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56474:13"/>Sanctification and Juſtification.</p>
               <p>If then we make our eſtimate of evangelical Juſtification according to the uſual ſignification of the word, as that implies in it the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the party tried, the <hi>Act</hi> of God as Judge, and the <hi>law and rule</hi> on which the trial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and by which the cauſe is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for him that is juſtified; then Juſtification may be thus deſcribed. <hi>It is that whereby God for the ſake and upon the account of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, doth approve of a true believer, as one that hath perfermed the condition on which God in the Goſpel, hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed pardon of ſin and eternal life, and doth impute that performance to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and accordingly adjudgeth him to be righteous in the ſenſe and according to the tenor of the law of Grace, and ſuch an one as hath a Covenant, right and title to the bleſſings promiſed in that Covenant, pardon of Sin and eternal life.</hi> This deſcription of Juſtification, as it beſt agrees with the uſe and ſignification of the word and phraſe, ſo it does alſo with the doctrine of the Goſpel, as we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56474:14"/>ſhall afterwards ſee. Which that we may the better do, I ſhall open the whole to you by opening it in its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, and ſo ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt doth operate to our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How the Covenant of Grace doth it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How Faith doth it; and</p>
               <p n="4">4. How God himſelf doth it.</p>
               <p>And thus to open the whole nature of Juſtification, by ſhewing the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſeveral cauſes of it, is I conceive, the beſt and moſt likelieſt way to come to the cleareſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and beſt inſight into it that we can attain unto. The want of which diſtinctneſs in proceeding, hath been, I conceive, an occaſion in great part, of obſcuring the doctrine of Juſtification, while the parts have been confounded, and the operation proper to one cauſe, hath been attributed to another.</p>
               <p>The whole of the deſcription which I have given of Juſtification, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the operation of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Bleſſed Saviour, of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56474:14"/>of Grace, of faith, and of the whole action of Gods dijudication in juſtifying true believers; to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which I ſhall now proceed. And I ſhall begin with the righteouſneſs of our Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus, and ſhall enquire into the nature and operation of it in reference to our juſtification.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the nature of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and how it operates to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN ſhewing what influence our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours righteouſneſs hath into our Juſtification, two things will come under conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What we are to underſtand by the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How it <hi>operates</hi> to our <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Firſt of the former, what we are to underſtand by the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>Righteouſneſs is the conformity of a perſon to ſome Law or Rule.</hi> And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56474:15"/>therefore when we ſpeak of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, it ſuppoſeth ſome Law, in his conformity whereunto this righteouſneſs of his whereof we ſpeak, doth conſiſt. Which Law, is the <hi>Law of his Mediation,</hi> which he received from his Father, and which he voluntarily and moſt willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to obſerve and fulfil. The mutual agreement between the Father and the Son about this Law of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and man, and the Sons undertaking to fulfil it in order to our Redemption, Divines are wont to call <hi>the Covenant of Redemption.</hi> And as the great office of Mediator is peculiar to him alone, (for there is but one Mediator between God and man, even the man Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.) So the Law of this Mediation was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him. And as the law and office of Mediation were peculiar to our Saviour, ſo is his righteouſneſs which conſiſteth in his conformity to that law: it is <hi>a Mediatory Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The benefit of it belongs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56474:15"/>the righteouſneſs it ſelf which is Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial, can be no more transferred to any other, than his office of Mediation can: for his righteouſneſs conſiſts in thoſe acts of conformity to the Law of Mediation by which he doth execute his office of Mediation.</p>
               <p>Now that there was ſuch a Law of Mediation between God and man, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God the Father to Chriſt his Son, and which he did moſt readily accept of, execute and obey, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known to us by our Saviour himſelf, by many of his ſayings. As in <hi>John</hi> 6.38. when he ſays, <hi>I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> And again, <hi>the Father which ſent me, he gave me commandment what I ſhould ſay and what I ſhould ſpeak. Whatſoever I ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak,</hi> John 12.49.50. Our Saviour ſpeaking of his <hi>laying down his life for his ſheep,</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again: this commandment have I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56474:16"/>received of my Father</hi> (mark that) <hi>John</hi> 10.18. To fulfil this Law was the deſign of our Saviours coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of thy book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God,</hi> And of the fulfilling of this law, our Saviour ſpake, when in his prayer to his Father he ſaid, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> John 17.4.</p>
               <p>Theſe with other like Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with theſe two things. Firſt, that there was a Law given by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and choſen by the Son, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in managing the office and work of Mediator between God and man, which we call the <hi>Law of Mediation.</hi> Secondly, that our Saviour did exactly obſerve, obey and fulfil this Law. And if ſo, we may know what that Law was by what he hath done, ſpoken and ſuffered in the execution of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial office.</p>
               <p>Now what he <hi>did, ſpake and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in <hi>conformity to this Law,</hi> is that which we call his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56474:16"/>Righteouſneſs. His coming into the world and his taking our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, was an act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this Law. <hi>I am not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>come of myſelf, but he that ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. John 7.28. <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10.5. What he did and preached here in the world, was in obedience to this Law. <hi>I can</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of mine own ſelf do nothing:</hi> as I hear I judge, and my judgment is juſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me,</hi> John 5.30. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, yea thy law is in my heart,</hi> Heb. 10.7. <hi>with</hi> Pſal. 40.8. His conformity and obedience to the natural Law as a man, and to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Jew, was part of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial obedience. For he was made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. His preaching the Goſpel was an act of obedience to this Law. I do nothing of my ſelf, but as <hi>my father hath taught me, I ſpeak theſe things,</hi> John 8.28. <hi>I have not ſpoke of my ſelf, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56474:17"/>what I ſhould ſay and what I ſhould ſpeak. Whatſoever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak,</hi> John 12.49, 50. His laying down his life was another eminent act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this law. <hi>He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and became obedient unto death,</hi> even the death of the croſs. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I lay down my life and I take it again, this commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> John 10.18. By theſe and other like acts of obedience and conformity to this law of Mediation, did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour fulfil all righteouſneſs. And by this righteouſneſs of his we are made righteous and ſo juſtified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> By theſe things we may know what we are to underſtand by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which was the firſt thing I was to enquire into about it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing I am to enquire into is, how this <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt doth <hi>operate</hi> to our <hi>Juſtification.</hi> In doing of which I ſhall enquire into two
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56474:17"/>things, by the underſtanding of which we may come to know how the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Saviour operates to our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>reaſon and end</hi> of this law of Mediation, and of the acts of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator in conformity to it, from which this righteouſneſs of Chriſt doth reſult.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon what the <hi>efficacy and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive virtue</hi> of this righteouſneſs doth <hi>depend,</hi> in reference to this <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe. The end in general of the law of Mediation and of our Saviours obedience to it, was to deliver us from the wrath to come, and to bring us to everlaſting life. The ſubordinate end was Reconciliation between God and men: And as a means to this end, the obtaining and granting a Conditional pardon for all the world: and a new Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that condition, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt and laſt end next to Gods glory, of the law of Mediation and of the obedience of the Mediator to it, was to <hi>recover</hi> us from the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56474:18"/>condition into which our ſin had brought us, and to <hi>reſtore</hi> us to a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of enjoying everlaſting life. When our Saviour had ſaid, I have not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of my ſelf, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a commandment what I ſhould ſay and what I ſhould ſpeak, (this we ſee was one part of the Law given to the Mediator) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds this; and I know that his <hi>commandment is everlaſting Life:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that to that end it was deſigned, and to that end it doth directly tend, <hi>John</hi> 12.49.50. And again, <hi>I am come,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly;</hi> this was the great end of his coming, <hi>John</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next end of it in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubſerviency to the former, was to <hi>Reconcile us to God,</hi> by altering our nature, by altering the frame and temper of the mind and heart, and ſo of a mans ways and life, from carnal to Spiritual, without which there is no reconciliation wrought in us to God, nor conſequently of God to us. For
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56474:18"/>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the carnal mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, becauſe it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be</hi> Rom. 8.7. And he that is at enmity againſt God, is far from being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him, and from a capacity of being made happy by him. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, nor without holineſs ſhall ſee God, till then he is no capable ſubject of ſuch happineſs. And therefore to effect this to make us capable of the former end, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in obedience to the Mediatorial Law, <hi>gave himſelf for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> Tit. 2.14. He ſuffered for us the Juſt for the unjuſt, <hi>that he might bring us unto God,</hi> by way of return from our revolt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He loved his Church and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, that he might preſent it unto himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Eph. 5.25, 26.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The next end of our Saviours Mediatorial obedience or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as a means to accompliſh and bring about the former end laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was the obtaining, the forming and granting of a <hi>Conditional pardon</hi> for all mankind, <hi>In him we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins.</hi> Eph. 1.7. He is the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the world,</hi> John 1.29. <hi>The propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Sins of the whole world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2. <hi>He gave his fleſh for the life of the world,</hi> John 6. <hi>and himſelf a Ranſom for all,</hi> 1. Tim. 2.6. I will not deny but that this giving himſelf a Ranſom for all, and taſting death for every man, may in one reſpect be ſaid to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and unconditional, and did extend as far and to as many as ever the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> did in its effects; and that is, in Redeeming all men from obnoxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to eternal miſery, meerly upon the account of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, or the ſin of any other, ſave their own perſonal ſins. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die: the ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56474:19"/>this reſpect,</hi> Ezek. 18.20. In reſpect of the extent and univerſality of this effect, of Chriſts death, <hi>Adam</hi> might be ſaid to be the <hi>figure</hi> of him that was to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. But otherwiſe and in reference to ſuch as have contracted ill habits by their own actual ſin, the pardon obtained by our Saviour for the whole world, or which he came to obtain, was but Conditional, it was upon condition of their being prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal to be reconciled unto God. Otherwiſe, and if this were not ſo, all would have been ſaved, whether they believed and repented or no. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Saviour hath ſaid it, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned, and that repenteth not ſhall periſh. Though God ſo loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, yet he loved it <hi>but ſo</hi> as to promiſe ſalvation by him, only to thoſe that believe, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. Now this pardon thus obtained and granted, upon account of our Saviours obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto death, but upon condition of mens being perſuaded to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, and yet certain to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56474:20"/>conferred upon that condition, is a moſt powerful motive and means to perſuade men to be reconciled to God, when it comes to be divulged and made known, and when it is believed that pardon is certainly to be obtained this way and no way without it. And therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of it as the Method uſed by God to reconcile the world to himſelf, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes:</hi> that is provided they would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perſiſt in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another end of the Mediatorial obedience of our Saviour ſubordinate to the former, (that laſt mentioned) and as a means to effect it, was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and founding of a <hi>new Law of Grace,</hi> the new Covenant, promiſing both pardon and eternal life upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſtating and declaring that condition, to be publiſhed to the world as Gods great inſtrument of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with men to be reconciled to God in order to their obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56474:20"/>the Goſpel which is this new Law of Grace, is ſaid to be <hi>the power of God to Salvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it.</hi> Rom. 1.16. Now all having ſinned, no fleſh living could be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in a way of grace and mercy.</p>
               <p>And therefore there was a kind of neceſſity of a new Law, a Law of Grace, by virtue of which men ſhould be juſtified, if juſtified at all. But it did not ſeem meet to the divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to make ſuch a Law of Grace, but upon condition that ſome ſuch thing ſhould be undergone and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our bleſſed Saviour on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behalf, as would as well anſwer the end of the penalty of the original Law tranſgreſſed, as if that penalty had been inflicted on the tranſgreſſors of it themſelves. But this being done by the ſufferings of our Saviour, as I ſhall ſhew afterward, a fair way was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prepared for the Conſtituting a new Covenant, promiſing pardon and eternal life upon new terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſuch as are not only poſſible, but alſo feiſable as well as reaſonable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56474:21"/>in our ſtate and condition. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit through Faith, that is, that we might receive the bleſſing and benefits of a new Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. And accordingly the Scripture frequently repreſents to us, that the new Covenant is made with mankind upon account of what Chriſt did and ſuffered for us. It was not only ratified and confirmed by the Sacrifice of his death, but alſo thereby <hi>procured.</hi> This I ſay, ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that the <hi>Covenant that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before of God in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 3.17. And <hi>all the promiſes of God are in him, Yea, and in him, Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. And <hi>the New</hi> Teſtament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the New Teſtament in his bloud,</hi> Mat. 26.28. and his blood <hi>the bloud of the Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13.20. And when the Scriptures ſpeak of Gods <hi>promiſing eternal life before the world began,</hi> Tit. 1.2. and of Gods
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56474:21"/>
                  <hi>purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. they ſeem to refer to what God the Father promiſed Chriſt on the behalf of mankind upon his Mediatory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for them, even then when this was reſolved on and concluded by the Father and the Son, before the world began. For a concluſion of this matter, and to ſhew that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace was granted upon the account of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, hear what S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To them</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that have obtained like precious Faith with us through the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whether you take Faith here for the act of believing the Goſpel, or the Goſpel it ſelf as the object of Faith, which ſeems moſt likely, or for both, yet this is given through or upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the righteouſneſs of him who is both God and our Saviour.</p>
               <p>If you ask how the Mediatory righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of our Saviour in this ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of ends doth <hi>operate</hi> to our Juſtification? I anſwer, Our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56474:22"/>to God by being renewed in heart and life, is the matter of our Evangelical Righteouſneſs, upon which we are juſtified. For God juſtifies none that are not reconciled to him, nor which are not Evangelically righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. But then our reconciliation to God, and our becoming Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally righteous thereby, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified thereupon, as I ſhall after ſhew we are, are all owing to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory obedience or Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; for from that it is that they are what they are. And ſo far as theſe <hi>operate</hi> to our Juſtification, they do it in <hi>Virtue of Chriſts Mediatory perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> And ſo do thoſe two great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the hopes of the forgiveneſs of ſin and eternal life, by which we are perſuaded to be reconciled to God and to become Evangelically righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for theſe alſo are founded in the Mediatorial obedience of our Saviour, without which we could have had no ſuch hopes; and therefore Chriſt is well and worthily ſaid to be <hi>our hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. And then for the new
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56474:22"/>Covenant, as that operates to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as it is a new Law conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new Righteouſneſs, and as it is the rule according to which we are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as righteous, and adjudged to be righteous, when God juſtifies us, ſo this operation receives its life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and virtue from another opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is from the operation of the Mediatorial obedience and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Saviour, by which the Covenant it ſelf was obtained. Indeed all that any ways <hi>operates</hi> to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation, <hi>depends upon</hi> our Saviours Mediatorial performance, except what God himſelf doth: and yet what he himſelf doth in relation thereto, is ſtill done with reference to the undertaking and performance of his Son Jeſus Chriſt for us. Chriſt is the foundation which God himſelf hath laid, which bears up the whole fabrick of our Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which indeed is built upon it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundateon,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56474:23"/>ſaith God concerning Chriſt.</hi> All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpiritual bleſſings are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid to be conferred on us <hi>through</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, or <hi>by</hi> Chriſt, or <hi>in</hi> Chriſt. God <hi>reconciles us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt: preacheth peace to us by Jeſus Chriſt. The riches of his grace in his kindneſs towards us, is through Chriſt Jeſus; we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The promiſe of life is ſaid to be in Chriſt Jeſus. And eternal life the gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, The adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> with many more the like in Scripture. All which betokens that Spiritual benefits of all ſorts are vouchſafed us upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Mediatorial performance: <hi>The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.3. But theſe things I ſhall more fully open in that which follows, to which I ſhall now proceed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing then which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be enquired into, is, upon what the <hi>efficacy and operative virtue</hi> of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56474:23"/>this Mediatorial righteouſneſs of our Saviour doth <hi>depend</hi> in reference to our Juſtification, and indeed of all other ſaving benefits. And it ſeems to me to depend partly upon Gods <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and appointment to the end he and our Saviour deſigned it for: and partly upon the <hi>Aptitude</hi> of it, as a means to ſuch an end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It depends upon <hi>Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and appointment. For our Lord Chriſt <hi>is made to us of God,</hi> Wiſdom, <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. He is made Righteouſneſs to us by God, <hi>in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of his righteouſneſs: God order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and appointing that ſo it ſhould be. For this way of making us righteous by virtue of the righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is wholly of <hi>Divine inſtitution,</hi> and is ſupernatural, a way which the Law natural knows nothing of, nor we by it. When the Apoſtle had ſaid, ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſt, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. he preſently adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>by the which will we are ſanctified through the offering
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56474:24"/>of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> It appears to be of <hi>Divine inſtitution</hi> that the Mediatorial righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhould operate to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and other Spiritual benefits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the effect of it in the event is <hi>limited</hi> by God unto certain conditions: otherwiſe when Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, and taſted death for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, all would have been juſtified and ſaved thereby as well as ſome. For the price of Redemption was ſufficient for all as well as for ſome, if it had been as agreeable to the wiſdom of God, that all ſhould have been juſtified by his blood, as it is that thoſe <hi>only</hi> ſhall who ſhall be perſuaded to be <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> to him. And the obedience of Chriſt is in it ſelf as ſufficient to deliver thoſe who are reconciled to God, from temporal death which is the leſs evil, as it is to deliver them from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, which is the greater, had not the wiſdom of the Divine will made the difference. And we may well conceive that it is by virtue of the divine will, that <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56474:24"/>other good men who lived towards the beginning of the world, ſhould be juſtified and ſaved by virtue of this obedience of our Saviour to the Law of Mediation, thouſands of years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he actuated that obedience in the humane nature. The giving of Chriſt for us and the appointing him to the office and work of a Mediator, was an act of pure Grace. And in all dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it belongs to the doner to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and appoint how far and to what ends the benefit of them ſhall extend, and upon what terms they ſhall be conferred and enjoyed. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.16. That is, the terms on which the mercies are to be received, are not of the ordering and appointment of any other, but of God, whoſe the mercy is to beſtow. The wiſdom of God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns in all acts of his Grace. For <hi>he worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi> Eph. 1.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Operative</hi> virtue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial righteouſneſs of our Bleſſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56474:25"/>Saviour in reference to our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depends in great part at leaſt, upon the <hi>Aptitude</hi> of it as a means to ſuch an end. There is a bleſſed apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in what our Saviour hath done and ſuffered, to reconcile God and men, and ſo to procure mens Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The proper buſineſs of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, is to reconcile parties at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And the Mediatorial acts of our Saviour conformable to the Law of Mediation, in which his righteouſneſs doth conſiſt, were moſt apt and proper to procure Reconciliation between God offended and men offending: Some of them having in them a great fitneſs to reconcile God to men; to atone him and to take off his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt ſinners for what is paſt, provided they can be prevailed withal to lay down their arms of rebellion, humble themſelves, beg forgiveneſs, and return to their duty: And ſome of them have on the other hand a great aptitude in them to reconcile men to God. And by ſuch acts of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Mediatorial obedience as theſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56474:25"/>two ſorts conſiſt of, is the great and happy buſineſs of reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men brought about, and mens juſtification and pardon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. God never thought it fit to be reconciled to men, till they could be perſwaded to be reconciled to him. And men will never be perſuaded to be reconciled to God, till they have ſome good aſſurance that God will be reconciled to them upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſubmiſſion, and return. Now the acts of our Saviour's Mediatorial obedience ſerve very happily to both theſe ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have an excellent <hi>aptneſs</hi> in them to reconcile God to men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition of their compliance with thoſe reaſonable and eaſie terms upon which he hath declared himſelf willing to be reconciled to them. Our Saviours putting himſelf in our ſtead, and being content to ſuffer for us, to die for us, that we might not die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and thereby to make reparation for the affront we have put upon God, his law and government, is called <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56474:26"/>reconciliation for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and the <hi>making reconciliation for iniquity,</hi> by the Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of the aptneſs of this act of our Saviour's obedience, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God unto us upon ſuppoſition ſtill that we be brought thereby, and by other means, to be reconciled to God, is two-fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>value</hi> of the ranſome laid down; <hi>not ſilver and gold, but the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. the Blood of one who is God as well as man: <hi>the Church of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>purchaſed with his own Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. which according to the Scripture account, is a valuable conſideration for that which is deſigned to be obtained by it. Hence it is called a <hi>price,</hi> a price paid: <hi>ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. <hi>a purchaſe;</hi> that by which the purchaſe was bought and paid for: <hi>purchaſed with his own blood:</hi> A <hi>ranſom,</hi> that which is <hi>ſatisfactory to God,</hi> as being content to releaſe and diſcharge the ranſomed upon that account, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56474:26"/>they continue not in their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. Theſe metaphors being borrowed phraſes from what is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary among men, ſtill ſignifie a <hi>valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> conſideration given for what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereby. When we conſider that all Nations are but as the drop of the bucket or ſmall duſt of the balance in compariſon of God, and that that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who hath given himſelf a ranſom for us, is, God bleſſed for evermore, as well as man; we muſt needs conclude, that the <hi>dignity</hi> of his perſon, muſt needs add an infinite <hi>value</hi> to his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us, and be in the ſight of God of great price.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other reaſon of the aptneſs of our Saviours ſuffering for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God unto us, is taken from <hi>the congruity, analogy,</hi> or <hi>proportion</hi> that is in our Saviour's ſufferings, to anſwer the end of God's puniſhing ſinners themſelves. His ſuffering for us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers Gods end in puniſhing ſinners, as well, yea, better than if we our ſelves had ſuffered the demerit of our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56474:27"/>ſins, who come to be pardoned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. We are not to think, I conceive, that when God makes ſinners bear their iniquity themſelves in ſuffering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerits, that it is for their ſuffering-ſake that he does it, as if he were pleaſed or gratified with their ſuffering, meerly as ſuch, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful men uſe to be in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them on whom they revenge themſelves: or as the Devil is, in the deſtruction of men for deſtruction ſake: no certainly, God is only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch ſufferings of ſinners themſelves, as they ſerve to worthy ends and purpoſes. He hath plainly told us, that <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of him that dies,</hi> Ezek. 18.32. nay, hath ſworn <hi>as he lives,</hi> that he hath <hi>no pleaſure,</hi> no not in the <hi>death of the wicked,</hi> but that he turn from his way and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. If he had taken pleaſure in the ſuffering as ſuch of the ſinners themſelves, we cannot imagine that ever he would have given a command to his dear Son as he hath done, to ſuffer death to redeem guilty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56474:27"/>ſinners themſelves from eternal death, when they were all juſtly obnoxious to the judgment of God. God <hi>ſeeks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. which is an argument, that revenge dwells not in him; only as governor of the univerſe, he renders vengeance where the ends of Government call for it. Otherwiſe God ſaith, <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> Iſa. 27. God doubtleſs is only pleaſed with the ſuffering of wicked men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe ſufferings tend to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ends, and a <hi>publick good.</hi> For God, as a wiſe and good governour of his whole Creation of rational beings, deſigns the good of the whole by thoſe puniſhments which he inflicts upon ſome that are contumacious. To puniſh ſuch, is as neceſſary no doubt for the good of the Creation in general, as the cutting off delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents by the hand of publick Juſtice, is neceſſary to good order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Now the ends of puniſhments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the publick good of Gods
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56474:28"/>Creation in general, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>awaken</hi> and beget a ſenſe in Gods Creation, of the turpitude of ſin, how contrary it is to the holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, how hateful and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, and of how malignant a nature in reference to his creatures; that, wherever it faſtens, it cauſes great diſorders and diſturbances, ſetting men againſt God their maker, and one man againſt another, yea, every ſinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; and that it is it which hath brought in all the miſery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that is in the viſible and inviſible world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To maintain and <hi>keep up the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of God, and the honour of his Laws, by which he governs his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For puniſhments are the ſanction of Divine as well as they are of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws. If it were not for them the Laws of God would loſe much of their ſtrength, and of that awe and reverence which by means of them, is kept up in the minds of intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to whom they are made known.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56474:28"/>
               <p n="3">3. Another end of puniſhing ſome offenders for the good of the whole, is to <hi>deter</hi> others from falling into ſuch a hardened ſtate of rebellion againſt God, as for which final execution of Divine Juſtice paſſeth upon them. One great uſe of Gods viſible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here in this world upon notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offenders, is for caution to the reſt. Thus Gods Judgments upon the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> thouſands of years before, were for <hi>examples</hi> unto us, and for our <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> upon whom the ends of the world are come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6, 11. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in what befel them, are ſet forth for <hi>examples</hi> to the reſt of the world, ſuffering the vengeance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 7. And we do not know of what uſe to the inviſible world of Gods Creation, the execution of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice upon incorrigible offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is now or will be hereafter amongſt them. We ſee what is befallen the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels in the inviſible world, is made uſe of for admonition to thoſe of this viſible, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. And it's evident that the wiſe method of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56474:29"/>Gods proceeding in the matter of our Redemption, was deſigned as of good uſe to the inviſible world; it was <hi>to the intent that now unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church, the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Eph. 3.10. And it is not incredible, but that on the other hand, the puniſhment of obſtinate tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in another world for what they have done in this, may be of good uſe among them of the inviſible world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This puniſhing of ſinners in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world for impenitency in ſin in this, is, when it is made known, as it is now, of great uſe, <hi>to bring men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> when hope is given them, as there is, that they ſhall eſcape the like puniſhment upon their repentance, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like being the reaſon and ends of Gods inflicting puniſhment upon ſinners themſelves that are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, I am now to ſhew that theſe ends are as well, yea in ſome reſpect much better, provided for, and ſecured by the ſufferings of our Saviour for us,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56474:29"/>though we that are ſaved by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, do not ſuffer, than they would have been in caſe every ſinner without redemption, had born his own iniquity, and ſuffered for himſelf the deſert of his ſin.</p>
               <p>For in that, firſt, God would not ſpare his own Son when he eſpouſed the cauſe of ſinful men, not to juſtifie or defend them in it, but to ſuffer for them, rather than they ſhould have no terms granted them of eſcaping ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves what they had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: I ſay, when in this caſe God would not ſpare his own dear Son, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the dignity and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent worthineſs of his perſon, and the exceeding great intereſt he had in his Fathers love, he did thereby ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare and manifeſt as well as by inflicting puniſhment on ſinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how odious a thing ſin is in his ſight, how contrary to his nature, and how irreconcilable he is to it. Sin was condemned for as vile a thing as it is, as well by our Saviour's ſuffering in the fleſh for it in our ſtead, as it would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56474:30"/>have been by our ſuffering for it our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. he condemned ſin in the fleſh by being a Sacrifice for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Son of God's thus ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſinners ſtead for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the righteous Law of God, the authority of this Law is as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently maintained, and the goodneſs of it as ſufficiently vindicated, as it would have been by puniſhing thoſe ſinners themſelves, that are now ſaved by his ſufferings. For when God would not ſo much as give any hopes of pardon to ſuch as have tranſgreſs'd that law of his, no not upon condition of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without the ſuffering of ſuch an one as his own dear Son; no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that knows this, can have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or place left to deſpiſe or ſlight that Law, or the authority of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and not to be awed by it, nor to expect or hope for impunity in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No creature can take any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to commit ſin, or to continue in ſin, who conſiders how ſeverely the Son of God himſelf was dealt with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56474:30"/>by his merciful and moſt loving Father, in delivering him up to be crucified by wicked hands, beſides his other ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when he put himſelf in the ſinners place to undergo whatever his Father would pleaſe to inflict upon him, ſo that he might but thereby obtain a pardon for them, and that too but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of their reformation, and reconciliation to God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the end of inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is either for the reformation of the perſons themſelves that ſuffer, or of others by their example of ſuffering, ſo this end of ſinners ſuffering, was much better attained by our Saviour's ſuffering for our ſins, than if we our ſelves, that are ſaved by his death, had ſuffered for them what we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And the reaſon hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that are ſaved by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours death, are by his death firſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God in their nature and life; they are reformed, and of rebels made loyal ſubjects, which they never would have been, if they had ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the deſert of their ſin. And is it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56474:31"/>not much better that diſloyal and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient ſubjects be made dutiful, loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, obedient, and uſeful, than to be cut off for obſtinacy in rebellion? God had ſaid concerning wicked men, that he had much rather <hi>that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and live,</hi> than that they ſhould die in and for their iniquities: and our Lord his Son hath anſwered him in the joy of his heart, in that by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them in conjunction with other his performances on their behalf, he hath fulfilled his Fathers wiſh, and brought his deſire to paſs in reference to many ſuch ſinners. And moſt certain it is, that this is infinitely more pleaſing and <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to God, than if all mankind had ſuffered the pains of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death for their iniquities. This hath occaſioned, and will ſtill cauſe infinitely more joy in Heaven, and on Earth, and more triumphant thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving unto God, than there would have been if every ſinner had born his own burden. On this account, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's giving himſelf for us, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed emphatically <hi>an offering and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56474:31"/>of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1.</p>
               <p>All theſe things conſidered and put together, it appears upon a very rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal account, that there was a very great aptitude in this act of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's mediatorial obedience, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to men, when he delivered up himſelf to ſuffer for them on the terms he did, and ſo to operate to our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is an aptitude in our Bleſſed Saviour's Mediatorial <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> to reconcile God to men in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Juſtification; ſo there is in another reſpect an <hi>aptitude</hi> in it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>reconcile men to God</hi> in order to the ſame end. And that act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the law of Mediation which hath an aptitude in it this way, conſiſts at leaſt very much in a faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Prophetical Office as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. For by a faithful diſcharge of this truſt, and in obedience to this Law, he perſuades men by the great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and motives of the Goſpel, to be reconciled to God.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56474:32"/>
               <p>To this end he publiſhed the Goſpel, which he brought down from Heaven, Prophetically called his <hi>declaring the decree, Pſal.</hi> 2.7. And this was done in obedience to the Law of Mediation, given by his Father, as I have ſhewed from <hi>John</hi> 12.49. I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, ſaith he, <hi>but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi> As the Law was given in the hand of a Mediator, <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo was the Goſpel by Chriſt, the Mediator of a better Teſtament. And he confirmed it to be from God, by many ſigns and wonders, and mighty deeds which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the publication of it by him and his Apoſtles, having ſealed it with his own Blood. For after he had ſet it on foot himſelf, while he was on earth, and then ſealed to it by his death, he afterwards, when he left the world and aſcended up on high, left behind him by way of <hi>gift</hi> to the world, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers, to Miniſter the things of the Goſpel in his name; which Miniſtry
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56474:32"/>is called the <hi>Miniſtry of Reconciliation,</hi> and the Goſpel committed to their truſt, the <hi>Word of Reconciliation,</hi> and that which they were to do by it as his Ambaſſadors, was, to pray, beſeech, perſuade men in Chriſt's ſtead, <hi>to be reconciled</hi> to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. This firſt done by our Saviour in his Miniſtry, is continued by his Miniſters in his name, by perſuading men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and amendment of life, and to become ſincerely obedient unto God, in which their being reconciled to him doth conſiſt. And the way and means uſed by our Saviour, and his Embaſſadors, to perſuade men to be thus reconciled to God, was by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them with a ſtrong and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Belief</hi> of three things eſpecially, as great parts of the Goſpel our Saviour brought from Heaven with him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God would certainly be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi> to all ſinners, <hi>provided they would but be reconciled to him,</hi> and not ſtill perſiſt in their rebellion: that he will certainly pardon them, and treat them as friends, if they would deſiſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56474:33"/>from carrying it any longer as enemies to him. He hath ſent them word by his Meſſengers, that he is <hi>not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. that <hi>he would have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. And becauſe guilt makes men full of fears, and jealouſies of the avenger, and not apt to believe that ſuch as they have highly affronted, injured, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, can be reconciled to them, until they have avenged themſelves on them, if they have power to do it: therefore our Saviour to aſſure ſinners of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of God's deſire and intention of being reconciled to them, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, if they will but be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, hath not only given them his word for it, but a wonderful and great proof of it in what he hath done towards ſuch a thing before ever any ſuch favour was deſired or ſought for on their parts. God, he ſo loved the world, and was ſo unwilling to avenge himſelf on them, as that he hath given his only begotten Son, not only to tell
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56474:33"/>them ſo, but alſo to ſuffer for them, to prepare the way of reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>All this hath been done on God and his holy Sons part towards this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, before there was ever any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination on mans part of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God. <hi>God hath commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 4.9, 10. And doubtleſs this way of proceeding with enemies, if any, will make them willing to be reconciled to God: and it is indeed that which doth take with all but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate contumacious wretches. <hi>We love him,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 John 4.19. Our thoughts and inclinations of returning to God, and of being reconciled to him, of any love or good will towards him, take
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56474:34"/>their firſt riſe from intimations, yea, more than ſo, from manifeſtations of Gods love to us firſt, and eſpecially of ſuch love as the giving of his Son for us beſpeaks him to have to us. Hence the <hi>preaching of the Croſs,</hi> the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only that Chriſt hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but upon what account he hath ſuffered, is ſaid to be the <hi>power of God to them that are ſaved,</hi> that is, it is Gods powerful motive by which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades men of his willingneſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them, and by that means prevails with them to be willing to be reconciled to him. <hi>The preaching of the Croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs; but unto us which are ſaved, it is the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.18. <hi>All things,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, are of God, who hath reconciled us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given unto us the miniſtry of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> (what's that?) to wit, <hi>that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto them; and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. This is, we ſee, Gods way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56474:34"/>of reconciling the world unto himſelf, by making known to them, that upon account of his Son's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and ſuffering for them, he is freely willing to pardon them, and not to impute their treſpaſſes, but to be reconciled to them, provided they will be reconciled to him.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that our reconciliation to God (and not only God's reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to us) is ſo frequently as it is, attributed in Scripture to the death of Chriſt. <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. <hi>And that he might reconcile both</hi> (Jews and Gentiles) <hi>unto God in one body by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby, and came and preached peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16, 17. And again, <hi>having made peace by the Blood of his Croſs, it pleaſed the Father by him to reconcile all things to himſelf. And you that were ſometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56474:35"/>Col. 1.19, 20, 21, 22. By theſe and other like Scriptures we ſee, that one of God's great deſigns in giving his Son to die for us, was the reconciling us to himſelf, by aſſuring us, that upon condition of our being reconciled, we ſhould not have any the leaſt cauſe to queſtion his willingneſs to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us, and that it is by this, that he procures a willingneſs in us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him.</p>
               <p>This great tranſaction between the Father and the Son in behalf of the world, the Father's giving, and the Son's undertaking to die for the world in order to this great work of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, is the great and certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity unto men, that what was ſaid in the Goſpel touching Gods being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to ſinners, and his forgiving them, provided they will be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, ſhall be really performed and made good to them. Hence it is, that in regard that Chriſt was made Prieſt by the Oath of God to offer himſelf in Sacrifice to expiate ſin, and then in vertue of that Sacrifice to make
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56474:35"/>interceſſion for us, that he is ſaid to be made <hi>ſurety of the better Teſtament:</hi> that is, he by that means becomes a ſurety for God unto men, of the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his proffers and promiſes in the Goſpel to them, and of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them upon the condition of their being reconciled to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.20, 22. The Apoſtles inference is very natural and ſtrongly concluſive when he ſays, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. Gods giving his Son to die for us, is more than the beſtowing a pardon and eternal life upon us. And therefore he having done the greater already to procure our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to him, it is an earneſt, and a pledg that he will not ſtick to pardon and to ſave us, which is a leſs matter for him to give, if we become recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him indeed. If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, <hi>much more</hi> being reconciled, <hi>we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56474:36"/>
               <p>This aſſurance which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the world of his willingneſs to pardon and ſave ſinners by the death of his Son, as an earneſt and a pledg of it, if they wilfully refuſe not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reconciled to him, is that which in the firſt times in which this was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged to the wrrld, brought in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of it to Chriſt, who by him yielded up themſelves to God. In proſpect of which ſucceſs of this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſign of God upon the world by the death of his Son, it was that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. <hi>And I, if I he lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> So powerful a motive to reconcile ſinners to God, is God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration by giving his Son to die for them, of his willingneſs to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them, if they will but anſwer him in their willingneſs to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him. This is the firſt of the three things I mentioned, which have a great aptneſs in them to perſuade men to be reconciled to God, for which end, our Saviour does by the Goſpel, as he is Mediator of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56474:36"/>not only reveal this, but labours to poſſeſs men with a ſtrong <hi>belief of it,</hi> without which <hi>it will not operate</hi> on them at all towards ſuch an end as the reconciling them to God is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another of thoſe motives by which our Saviour by ſetting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel on foot, ſeeks to reconcile men to God, is by giving them great <hi>aſſurance</hi> that God is ſo far from deſiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf on them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their provocations, if they were but as willing as he is to be reconciled, as that in caſe they will be but perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be reconciled to God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their former rebellion, and by becoming really obedient to their power for the future, as that then he will <hi>beſtow</hi> upon them <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> advance them to ſuch a ſtate of happineſs, as that greater than which the heart of man cannot wiſh for or deſire. And ſurely this, if it be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, will, if any thing will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade men to be reconciled to God. To this end, our Saviour hath brought life and immortality to light by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56474:37"/>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. And by this motive he doth almoſt every where in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel perſuade to Faith, Love, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Obedience, and Holineſs, which is the ſame, with perſuading men to be reconciled to God; for in ſuch things as theſe, doth our reconciliation to God conſiſt. St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of this in a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying way, as the great motive to man to entertain and obey the Goſpel: <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the promiſe which he hath promiſed us, even eternal life,</hi> 1 John 2.25. And indeed it was this that did invite men to receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to profeſs the Chriſtian Religion at firſt, and which did animate them to ſuffer any thing rather than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and forſake it, and the hope of eternal life, which they had received by it. <hi>They took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing in themſelves, that they had in Heaven, a better, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſubſtance,</hi> Heb. 10.34.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a great <hi>aptitude</hi> in our Saviours ſetting the Goſpel on foot, to reconcile men to God, becauſe he thereby convinceth them, that if, after
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56474:37"/>God's gracious offer of being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them in caſe they will be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him: and if after all that hath been done by God, and ſuffered by his Son, to prepare the way for a mutual reconciliation between them, they ſhall yet <hi>obſtinately refuſe</hi> to be reconciled to God, and perſiſt ſtill in their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and diſobedience, <hi>That then God will be ſo far from</hi> being reconciled to them, and from pardoning them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the willingneſs he hath declared to be reconciled to them, upon condition of their recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to him: and notwithſtanding all that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered to bring this about, as that this offer of God, and undertaking of Chriſt, <hi>ſhall turn but to their heavier doom,</hi> and greater condemnation in the next world. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved darkneſs more than light,</hi> John 3.19. <hi>How ſhall we eſcpe if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord himſelf, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by them that heard him,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56474:38"/>Heb. 2.3. It ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah, and for Tyre and Sydon,</hi> in <hi>the day of Judgment,</hi> than for them that have refuſed to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, when by the Goſpel ſent to them, he hath offered to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them, on condition that they would be reconciled unto him.</p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with vain hopes of being ſaved, from the goodneſs of the nature of God, and the death of Jeſus Chriſt for ſinners, who yet take a liberty to live in known ſin without reconciling themſelves to God, by leaving it off, and returning to their duty, as too many alas do: there are two or three things revealed by Chriſt, to take from them ſuch vain hopes, and to put them upon a neceſſity of chuſing either to reconcile themſelves to God, or to be eternally miſerable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is taken from the <hi>nature</hi> of God. The nature of God is ſo pure and holy, and ſo contrary to ſin, that it is as impoſſible for him to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to ſin, or to ſinners, while by it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56474:38"/>they are in open rebellion againſt him, as it is for him to change his nature, and ceaſe to be God. <hi>This is the meſſage</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) which we have heard of him</hi> (that is, of Chriſt) <hi>and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all. If we ſay, that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth,</hi> 1 John 1.5. So that, according to this meſſage which Chriſt hath ſent to ſinners by his Meſſengers, it is as poſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile light and darkneſs, as God and ſuch as walk in darkneſs, that is in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> would make men themſelves judges in the caſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to their own reaſon, ſaying, <hi>What communion hath light with darkneſs, and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14, 15. and plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that if light and darkneſs are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable, and can have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo is Chriſt and <hi>Belial,</hi> or a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He hath taken away ſuch vain hopes from ſinners, by declaring by his Goſpel, <hi>That God without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56474:39"/>judgeth according to every mans work:</hi> that is, he will judg every man according to the right of his cauſe, without favouring or diſ-favouring the perſons of men againſt the nature and right of their cauſe: <hi>He that hath done good ſhall come forth to the reſurrection of life, and he that hath done evil unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> Even there where the Lord hath declared from heaven, that he is merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſin; even there he hath declared alſo, to the end men might not miſtake, <hi>that he will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> no, by no means, not upon any account whatſoever will he clear ſuch as are finally guilty, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in rebellion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. All ſuch perſons therefore as will not be perſuaded to be reconciled to God, by becoming obedient to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his laws, have no more reaſon to hope that they ſhall be ſaved upon the account of God's merciful nature, or the merits of Chriſt's death, than they have to hope that God for their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56474:39"/>ſakes will go contrary to all his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in his word, and contrary to the whole fixed frame of his government, by which he rules, and will judg the world. And what ſinner is there that can but give himſelf the liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things, that is or can be ſo vain in his expectation, as to promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any ſuch thing, ſince our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my word ſhall not paſs away,</hi> Mat. 24.35. Thoſe are the <hi>

               <p n="3">3. Our Saviour, to take away from men ſuch vain hopes, and to convince them of the neceſſity of their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, hath told them, that if they will not be reconciled to him, they cannot be <hi>reconciled to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that their nature cannot be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the happineſs of the next world, unleſs they are reconciled to God in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56474:40"/>this. <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3. Except ſuch as have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ill habits by bad living, be born again, they are not capable of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that ſtate. That is, in other words, except they <hi>put off the old man, and put on the new,</hi> Col. 3.10. or which is yet more plainly expreſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. except <hi>they put off concerning their former converſation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts, and be renewed in the ſpirit of their minds, and do put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs:</hi> except this be done, they cannot ſee the kingdom of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> they cannot enjoy it. He doth not ſay, they <hi>ſhall</hi> not, but that they <hi>cannot</hi> ſee it. And the reaſon is, becauſe the happineſs of the heavenly ſtate is of ſuch a nature, as between which and the nature of man, as vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and corrupt, there is no congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that which hath a contrariety in it to the nature of a creature, is not matter of pleaſure, but of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56474:40"/>to it. The holy God, the holy Jeſus, the holy Angels, and holy Men are the inhabitants of Heaven: And what felicity can unholy men take in ſuch company? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right are an abomination to the wicked,</hi> Prov. 29.27. And if they be ſo here, where they are but in part holy; how much more will they be ſo in the other world, when they are altogether ſo. <hi>What Communion,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs?</hi> no more than light with darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. They do not love God here as he is holy; nor is it pleaſure to them to think of him as ſuch; and therefore, unleſs they be ſanctified and made ſo here, they are not capable of enjoying God in the next world; in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whom, the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth conſiſt. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. And they are ſuch as <hi>are pure in heart,</hi> which ſhall ſee God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. Beſides, thoſe ſinful luſts which wicked men carry along with them into the next world, will keep them from being happy in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56474:41"/>what place ſoever they are, when they ſhall be deprived of thoſe carnal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſatisfie them, which they found in this world.</p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould think that God will be ſo merciful to them, as ſo to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and change their nature, when they come into the other world, as that they ſhall be capable of the happineſs of Heaven, though they are not changed in this; our Lord hath told them afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to prevent ſuch a conceit, that though <hi>many ſhall ſay unto him in that day, Lord, Lord, open unto us, for we have heard thee preach in our ſtreets, have eat and drunk in thy preſence, have propheſied and caſt out devils in thy name, and done many wonderful works,</hi> yet they having lived and died unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he will then ſay unto them, <hi>depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, I know you not,</hi> Mat. 7.22. Luke 13.25, 26. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> his Apoſtle hath told us alſo, that <hi>we muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive according to that he hath done in the body, whether it be good or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56474:41"/>bad. We muſt</hi> receive we ſee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is done in the body here in this life, before the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul and body by death, 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>Now is the accepted time, now the day of Salvation,</hi> and thoſe that out-ſtand this, it will be ſaid unto them, as our Saviour doth in Rev. 22.11. <hi>He that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill, and he that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all theſe Revelations made by our Saviour, he hath (as any that will conſider them may eaſily ſee) put men upon a neceſſity of being reconciled to God, unleſs they had rather chuſe to be everlaſtingly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. And in this with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Motives, there is a very great <hi>aptitude</hi> to reconciel men to God, as the reaſon of the thing ſhews, and the event hath declared.</p>
               <p>And thus we have now ſeen how the Mediatory Righteouſneſs of our Saviour, his obedience in executing the Law of Mediation, doth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to our Juſtification, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56474:42"/>both to God and men. By his ſufferings he reconciled God to penitent ſinners, by making ſatisfaction to his governing Juſtice, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the ends of his inflicting puniſhment upon impenitent offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, while he ſpares the penitent. And by the Goſpel which he hath ſet on foot, the Holy Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, he reconciles men to God; that is, he reconciles their minds and wills, their lives and actions to Gods Holy Nature, Government and Laws, which is their Evangelical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in which capacity, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers them up to God to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Pardoned, according to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace, which he likewiſe obtained for us, it being founded on his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obedience; of which Covenant I am now in the next place to ſpeak.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>How and in what reſpect the Covenant of Grace operates to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace <hi>operates</hi> to our Juſtification in ſeveral reſpects. But however it doth this or in what reſpect ſoever; yet all that operation is owing to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Righteouſneſs or Obedience of our Saviour. For I have ſhewed in what goes before, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelf was obtained by and founded in the Mediatorial Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Saviour; the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, was one of the ends of the Office and Work of Chriſt as Mediator. And as it is one of the effects of our Saviours death, it is called a Teſtament, though in other reſpects it is called a Covenant, yea a Law. As its promiſes are made by God on <hi>condition</hi> of duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56474:43"/>by us, ſo it is a <hi>pact</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> As it <hi>abſolutely enjoyns</hi> that as duty, which is alſo the condition of our happineſs, ſo it is a <hi>Law.</hi> But as it comes out of the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, and is the <hi>Fruit of his death,</hi> ſo it is a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> becauſe by that it receives its vigor and ſtrength. <hi>A Teſtament,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is of force when men are dead; otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all while the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor liveth,</hi> Heb. 9.17. This being premiſed, I come now to ſhew in what reſpects this Covenant ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to our Juſtification. And this it doth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>reconciling</hi> the <hi>Natural Law</hi> to the terms of the Law of Grace in the behalf of Repentant ſinners, in virtue of the death of Chriſt for them; whoſe Juſtification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Natural Law was againſt, while they remained impenitent. By the Natural Law I mean, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon or wiſdom by which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God does always that which is fit and becoming him towards his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56474:43"/>creatures; and that by which his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do or ought to do what is fit and becoming them towards God, towards themſelves and one another. And this is ſaid to be the <hi>Natural</hi> Law, becauſe its determinations and awards are ſuited to the <hi>nature of things.</hi> As when innocent creatures are uſed as ſuch, and obſtinate ſinners dealt with as ſuch, and repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners treated as ſuch; and when crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are more or leſs puniſhed or rewarded according as they have been and done more or leſs wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly or worthily: or as when God does render to every one according to his works without reſpect of perſons, as the Scripture ſpeaks. Now to do according to the nature of things is to do according to right reaſon, and to do ſo is always well becoming the Agent, whether it be God or man, and cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. To this Law that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> refers when he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever things are true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, of good report, if there be any virtue
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56474:44"/>and praiſe, think on theſe things.</hi> Phil. 4.8.</p>
               <p>This then being the Natural Law, it muſt needs be always <hi>againſt</hi> the Juſtification and Pardon of <hi>impenitent</hi> obſtinate ſinners and irreconcilable enemies; for it would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of things, not according to right reaſon, and ſo not becoming the Agent, if the bad ſhould be treated as well as the good.</p>
               <p>But then on the other hand, the Natural Law cannot be againſt the juſtifying and pardoning of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners for whom Chriſt died; Becauſe the caſe of ſuch is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from theirs who continue in their rebellion, and who have no ſhare in the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath made in the behalf of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinners. Now the caſe of ſuch being thus different, it would not be according to the nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of things, and ſo not according to the Natural Law, if they ſhould be no more pardoned than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56474:44"/>Conſidering what our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour hath done and ſuffered to atone God and to obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and happineſs for repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſuch as are greatly diſpleaſed with themſelves for having diſpleaſed God; and that judg and condemn themſelves as guilty of folly and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death; that deprecate Gods diſpleaſure, beg forgiveneſs and return to their duty; it cannot but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature and reaſon of the thing, and very well becoming ſo good a being as God is, for him, for Chriſts ſake to pardon ſuch, and to reward their future Faithfulneſs, and ſincere obedience with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs.</p>
               <p>And ſo much the rather it is ſo, becauſe by the death of Chriſt for ſuch as return to God after their apoſtacy from him, the great and wiſe <hi>ends</hi> of Gods Government over all intelligent beings, which center in the <hi>publick good,</hi> are <hi>ſecured</hi> as well, yea better, as I have ſhewed before, than they would been by puniſhing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56474:45"/>repentant ſinners themſelves for their Offences. By the ſecuring of which ends of Gods Government, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Natural Law is fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſatisfied. The <hi>publick good</hi> in Gods Dominions, is a great end of his Government: and this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good is promoted by Gods juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and pardoning repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for Chriſts ſake, becauſe by his doing ſo, ſinners are prevailed with and perſuaded to repent, amend, and reform, and of bad to become good, and of unprofitable and diſſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to become uſeful and profitable members in Gods Kingdom, to the increaſing and multiplying of ſuch in it, to the great joy and ſatisfaction of the whole. For which cauſe it's ſaid, <hi>There is joy in heaven over every one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> Luke 15.</p>
               <p>Again, it muſt needs be agreeable to the Natural Law, for God, for Chriſts ſake to juſtifie and pardon repentant and reformed ſinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is agreeable to his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For that which is agreeable
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56474:45"/>to the nature of God, muſt needs agree to the Natural Law, becauſe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law is founded in the Nature of God. Now for God to ſhew <hi>mercy</hi> to his creatures in all <hi>compaſſionable caſes,</hi> is as natural to him as to do juſtly; mercy being as eſſential to God as juſtice or any other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his is. And there is no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for mercy to ſhew it ſelf but in compaſſionable caſes. And if the caſe of repenting and reformed ſinners, for whom Chriſt died, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt made but fallible, be not a compaſſionable caſe, I know not what is or where any will be found for God to exerciſe his mercy in.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Law of Grace does not, nor indeed can, <hi>Cancel or Relax</hi> the Natural Law in any part (though I confeſs I with others have ſome time thought otherwiſe) and the reaſon is, becauſe the Natural Law is naturally what it is and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe. That which is in it ſelf fiteſt to be done, can never be otherwiſe under the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56474:46"/>in which it is ſo. The change or alteration is not in the Law when it favours the ſame perſons at one time whom it disfavoured, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, before: but the change is made in the perſons themſelves, and in the change of the circumſtances of their Caſe, by reaſon of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſts performance for them, and of their intereſt in the promiſe of the Law of Grace, they having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition on which their intereſt in the benefit of Chriſts death and in the promiſes of the Goſpel, were ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>The Law <hi>curſeth all</hi> tranſgreſſors of it as ſuch: and they remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it until they are <hi>redeemed from it,</hi> and removed from under it by Chriſts having <hi>born it for them.</hi> So that the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law is <hi>not Cancelled,</hi> but undergon by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for us. He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law by being made a curſe for us, not by altering the Law for us, Gal. 3.13. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath told us, <hi>that he which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56474:46"/>not is condemned already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not received the remedy by which he might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that condemnation into which he was fallen. John 3.18. He was under the condemnation of the Law Natural, before as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of that, and is now under the condemnation of the Goſpel, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter of the Grace offered by that. But when ſuch an one comes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he is no longer under the condemnation of either Law or Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but both are reconciled to him through Chriſt, becauſe by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he is reconciled to them: not becauſe they are in the leaſt altered, but becauſe the man himſelf is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the circumſtances of his caſe are altered upon the account of Chriſts performance for him.</p>
               <p>We cannot ſay that the Natural Law was ever againſt the juſtification and pardoning of ſuch repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for whom Chriſt undertook to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56474:47"/>ſuffer: for if it had, it would be ſo ſtill now he hath ſuffered: for that Law is intirely unalterable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible. <hi>Till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law,</hi> ſaith our Saviour until all be fulfilled, Mat. 5.18. Now if the Law were never againſt the juſtification and pardon of ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents as aforeſaid, then there needed no alteration to be made in it to make way for their juſtification and pardon.</p>
               <p>And as all this appears as we ſee from reaſons taken from the nature of God, and from the nature of the Law it ſelf as reconciled by the death of Chriſt to penitent ſinners: So it appears alſo by expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch repentant ſinners as in whom were found the fruits of the Spirit, ſaith, <hi>that againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> Gal. 5.23. and if no Law, then not the Natural Law. And when in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place the queſtion is put, whether it may be ſaid that <hi>the Law
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56474:47"/>is againſt the promiſe of God?</hi> He rejects it with a kind of indignation, ſaying, <hi>God forbid.</hi> Gal. 3.21.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, for God to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, pardon, and make men happy, when in vouchſafing this favour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant perſons, upon account of the death of his Son, his Authority, Law, and Government, is not left unvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, nor the ends of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unſecured, nor any creature hurt by it, it is doubtleſs agreeable to the higheſt reaſon, and therefore congruous to the Law Natural, and infinitely becoming ſo good a being as God is. And it may very well be, that upon this account God is ſaid to <hi>be juſt in juſtifying him that believeth in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.26. and <hi>faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 John 1.9.</p>
               <p>And this doubtleſs is the <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> which God the Father receives by the ſuffering of his Son for our ſins, about which there have been ſo many diſputes in the world. It is doubtleſs infinitely <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> and well pleaſing to Almighty God, that by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56474:48"/>means of his Sons ſuffering, he can now ſhew Mercy to repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in juſtifying, pardoning, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, without ſuffering the leaſt diſhonor or ſuſpition of diſhonor in reference either to his Nature, Law, or Government, and in full compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the immutable Law of Righteouſneſs and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Nor will it follow from what hath been diſcourſed (as ſome perhaps may object) that the Natural Law, and the Law of Grace are all one. For although the Natural Law is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the favour exhibited by the Law of Grace, upon the <hi>reaſon and the terms</hi> on which it is done: yet the Revelation of that <hi>reaſon</hi> which is the Mediatorial performance of Chriſt, is not made by the Natural Law, but by the Goſpel or Law of Grace. For no man can merely by any natural light know it, but is knowable only by the Goſpel Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Law of Grace. <hi>The natural man cannot know the things of the ſpirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56474:48"/>diſcerned:</hi> that is by means purely ſpiritual or ſupernatural. 1 Cor. 2.14. For this reaſon and by reaſon of all the honor which redounds to the Eternal Father and to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all the benefit which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to men, by this <hi>Revelation,</hi> which is exceeding great, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that this Law of Grace ſhould be conſtituted and publiſhed, as a Law diſtinct from the Natural Law.</p>
               <p>But whereas the Scripture in ſome places ſeems to repreſent the Law and the Promiſe as <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> ſo that if one take place upon a perſon, the other muſt in ſome ſort give way, according as I my ſelf have ſomtimes thought; I ſhall now look a little more narrowly into thoſe Texts. In Rom. 4.14. i'ts ſaid, <hi>If they which are of the Law be heirs, faith is made void and the promiſe made of none effect.</hi> And again, Gal. 3.18. <hi>If the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe: but God gave it unto</hi> Abraham <hi>by promiſe.</hi> For a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandnig of theſe and ſuch like
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56474:49"/>Scriptures, we muſt conſider that the Apoſtle doth not in them repreſent the inconſiſtency of the Law and the Promiſe as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in their proper uſe, and rightly underſtood; but he therein repreſents the erroneouſneſs of their opinion againſt whom he diſputes, upon the account of the <hi>abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it, as rendring the Law and the Promiſe inconſiſtent.</hi> For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks his own ſenſe of the Law and Promiſe, he with great vehemency denies the Law to be againſt the Promiſes, when he ſays, <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes?</hi> God forbid. Gal. 3.21.</p>
               <p>The caſe was this; the Phariſaical Jews, held Righteouſneſs or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be by the Law, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to its being by Grace. <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> (meaning that he did not do it by his doctrine, as they did by theirs) <hi>for if righteouſneſs come by the Law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> Gal. 2.21. They held their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56474:49"/>legal performances were <hi>of themſelves</hi> a Righteouſneſs that would <hi>of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> Juſtifie them before God. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught that it was meerly <hi>by grace and by virtue of Chriſts death,</hi> that the faith and ſincere though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imperfect obedience of ſuch as have been once ſinners, is <hi>imputed or counted</hi> to them for Righteouſneſs. So that their opinion of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs coming by the Law, if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would have rendred the death of Chriſt to be in vain, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of none effect or uſeleſs, which yet proceeded from Grace, and was in it ſelf an act of Gods Grace. And <hi>if righteouſneſs had been by works</hi> in their ſenſe, <hi>then it would not have been of Grace, otherwiſe Grrace would have no more Grace,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons. But <hi>if it was of Grace,</hi> as the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that it was, <hi>then it could not be of works</hi> in their ſence, <hi>otherwiſe work would be no more work.</hi> Rom. 11.6.</p>
               <p>So that the drift of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his writings was to ſhew, that their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56474:50"/>of Juſtification by the Law, was pernicious, for that it oppoſed the Law to the Promiſe, as render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promiſe uſeleſs: But that his doctrine of Juſtification <hi>by Grace through Faith,</hi> did not <hi>evacuate</hi> the Law nor make it uſeleſs in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Juſtification, but rendered both very well conſiſtent. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God forbid: yea we eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Law.</hi> Rom. 3.31. The good men among the Jews under the Law, were Juſtified by Grace, even then when they were approved of for Righteous upon the account of their ſincere obedience to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and accordingly they depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Grace and Mercy of God for acceptation and approbation in their ſincere obſervation of all his Laws. And therefore they from time to time ſtiled him a God keeping Covenant and <hi>Mercy</hi> with them that love him and keep his Commandments, or that walk before with all their hearts. And though the <hi>hearers of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56474:50"/>the Law were not juſt before God,</hi> yet <hi>the doers of Law were juſtified,</hi> when they depended upon the Grace and Mercy of God for acceptation in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty. Rom. 2.13.</p>
               <p>Conclude we then, that there is nothing in theſe Scriptures to prove the Natural Law and the Law of Grace, not to conſiſt without the one being altered by the other.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how the Law of Grace operates to our Juſtification, by reconciling the Original Law to us upon our repentance that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; it is reconciled to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are reconciled to it by the Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>By the way then it is remarkable, how greatly it conduceth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of all truly repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of how great a ground of their confidence towards God it is, that the Natural Law as well as the Law of Grace, is now on their ſide: it is not only not againſt them, but is made to be for them by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed undertaking and performance of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56474:51"/>our Saviour for them, when once they are perſuaded to be ſincerely for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Grace ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to our Juſtification, as it is an <hi>act of Grace</hi> by which God doth <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute</hi> and <hi>ordain,</hi> that Faith as it is an operative principle of ſincerity of repentance, of love to God and man, and of all holy obedience, ſhall be accepted and <hi>accounted for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> upon the account of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Mediatory Righteouſneſs. And for our better underſtanding and ſatisfaction in this matter, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew that there is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs found among men, which the Scripture calls ſo, and calls thoſe Righteous that have it, their having ſinned notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew what it is and in what it conſiſteth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How it comes to be ſuch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is <hi>a Righteouſneſs</hi> found among men which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls ſo, and calls thoſe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56474:51"/>which have it, notwithſtanding all the world ſtand guilty before God of unrighteouſneſs, and are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under ſin, according to the firſt Law we were under. This is a thing ſo well known to thoſe that read the Scriptures or hear them read, that it's needleſs to cite particular Texts to prove it. We ſhall find that good men ſuch as are juſtified, are called the <hi>Righteous</hi> or the Juſt, no leſs I think than fourſcore times in the Books of <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Proverbs,</hi> beſides ſo many other places, as are not eaſily to be numbered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is more neceſſary is to ſhew <hi>what this Righteouſneſs is,</hi> and wherein it doth conſiſt. In general it conſiſteth in <hi>our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the terms of the Goſpel,</hi> the new Covenant or Law of Grace. As mans Natural and Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſtood in a <hi>conformity</hi> in his nature and actions to the <hi>Original Law</hi> of Righteouſneſs, from which we are fallen: And as the Mediatorial Righteouſneſs of Chriſt conſiſteth in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56474:52"/>his <hi>conformity to the Law of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi> ſo doth the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of a Chriſtian ſtand in his <hi>conformity to the terms of the new Law of Grace.</hi> And therefore as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel it ſelf is frequently called <hi>the Faith,</hi> and ſomtimes the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> as being both the Object and the Rule of the Chriſtian Faith; ſo is a Chriſtians conformity to it, frequently ſtiled likewiſe, <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> and <hi>the Righteouſneſs by Faith,</hi> and the <hi>obedience of Faith.</hi> Rom. 3.22. and 4.11, 13. and 9.30. and 10.6. Gal. 5.5. Phil. 3.9. Rom. 16.26.</p>
               <p>Now this conformity to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which God counts to us for Righteouſneſs, doth conſiſt in a hearty belief or <hi>firm perſuaſion</hi> that God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of what Chriſt our Mediator hath ſuffered and done for ſinners, will receive ſuch into his favour, pardon and ſave them, as upon ſuch a belief do truly repent them of their ſins, and ſeriouſly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve</hi> and ſincerely <hi>endeavour</hi> to pleaſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56474:52"/>God for the future, in the whole courſe of their lives; and in <hi>actual</hi> reſolutions and endeavours <hi>ſuitable to this belief.</hi> This belief or perſuaſion when it becomes thus <hi>practical</hi> in operations proper to the nature of ſuch a perſuaſion; as it is then the true Chriſtian Faith, ſo it is then alſo the Chriſtians <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> for it is imputed, reckoned and counted to them for Righteouſneſs, as the Scripture ſhews.</p>
               <p>It's true, <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have had this Righteouſneſs (Rom. 4.11.) and <hi>Noah</hi> to be an <hi>heir of it,</hi> Heb. 11.7. And yet we cannot ſay that they had any ſuch explicite Faith in reference to Chriſt the Mediator, as the meaneſt Chriſtian has under the Goſpel Revelation. And yet their Faith in the general nature of it, was the ſame then with the Chriſtians now. For they had ſuch Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by God one way or other, by which they did believe him to be reconcileable and propitious to all ſuch as fear and love him, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56474:53"/>endeavour to pleaſe him. And upon this Principle doubtleſs it was, that they and other good men in thoſe elder times, lived ſuch holy and virtuous lives, as hath procured them upon publick Record, honour and renown for Righteous men, unto all Generations. For ſo ſaith that ſacred Author ſpeaking of them Heb. 11.39. <hi>Theſe all received a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port through Faith.</hi> Thus <hi>Abel ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained witneſs even from God</hi> himſelf <hi>that he was Righteous,</hi> by reaſon of his Faith in God, in conjunction with what he did by virtue of his Faith, Heb. 11.4. And when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith (Jam. 2.) of ſome of theſe that they were juſtified not <hi>only</hi> by their <hi>Faith</hi> but alſo by their <hi>Works:</hi> the meaning I doubt not is, that they were <hi>approved</hi> of by God as Righteous men upon the account of <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true indeed Righteous and Holy men are frequently deſcribed by their fear of God, and by their love and obedience to him, without
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56474:53"/>mentioning their Faith; as at other times they are deſcribed by their Faith, without mentioning their fear, love or obedience. And the reaſon ſeems to be this, becauſe where any one of theſe is in truth, there are the other alſo. No man truly fears God or loves and obeys him, but he that hath firſt Faith towards God that he is Gracious, Merciful and ready to forgive the repenting and reforming ſinner: without which Faith, it is impoſſible to love him or reverence him with an awful love. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with him that he may be feared:</hi> feared with a fear mixed with love, as the right fear of God always is. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4.</p>
               <p>Now this their fear of God, love to him and care to pleaſe him which grows out of their Faith, is as I ſay their Righteouſneſs as well as their Faith it ſelf more ſtrictly conſidered; becauſe their conformity to the Law of Grace, which is their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſiſts in theſe as well as in that, and the ſame promiſes are made
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56474:54"/>to theſe as to that. <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs is Righteoas.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7. <hi>All his tranſgreſſions which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him: in his Righteouſneſs which he hath done, he ſhall live,</hi> Ezek. 18.22.</p>
               <p>And when I ſay that our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the terms of the Law of Grace is our Righteouſneſs, it is to be underſtood of ſuch a conformity as is <hi>hearty and ſincere,</hi> and in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man as well as the outward, though otherwiſe it be not indefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in reſpect of extent and degree. For therein lies the difference between the perfect Legal Righteouſneſs, and the Evangelical. The Legal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſtood in a perfect and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective conformity to whatever God commanded or the Law of Nature required of man. But the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Righteouſneſs ſtands in a hearty and ſincere deſire, reſolution and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in a man to conform to all that God requires, in conjunction with repentance for defects, and in affiance in Gods Mercy through Chriſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56474:54"/>for forgiveneſs. Although the beſt man living does not perhaps keep any one of Gods Commandments in a <hi>Legal ſenſe,</hi> yet the meaneſt ſincere Chriſtian keeps them all in an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſenſe;</hi> that is, in ſincerity of reſolution and endeavour. <hi>He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him ſelf to doe his Maſters will,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. by reſolving and endeavouring to do it as well as he can, and by making uſe of all due means and helps to that end. And in this ſenſe good men are in Scripture ſaid <hi>to keep Gods Charge, his Commandments, his Statutes and his Laws,</hi> Gen. 26.5. 2 Sam. 22.22. 1 Kings 14.8. 2 Kings 18.6. Job 23.11. Pſal. 119.22, 55, 56, 67, 68. Luk. 1.6. Not that they did ſo in the Legal ſenſe: For ſo, <hi>there is not a juſt man upon earth that doeth good and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.10. But they are ſaid to keep the Commandments in reſpect of the ſincerity of their endeavour, doing as well as they can. They <hi>follow after Righteouſneſs,</hi> and by this good men are deſcribed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56474:55"/>and God is ſaid to love ſuch as do ſo. Pro. 15.9. and 21.21. Iſa. 51.1. They ſtill labour to do and to grow better and better: and this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of endeavour proceeding from a Principle of Faith, is it by which men in Scripture are denominated Righteous: for more than this I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not-ſay is found in any man, and leſs than this I cannot ſay will denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any man to be a good tnd Righteous man.</p>
               <p>Our endeavours do not indeed <hi>of themſelves</hi> and <hi>without the aſſiſtance</hi> of Gods Holy Spirit, make us of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to become Righteous. But when ever men are perſuaded in their own minds to begin with honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do their duty as well as they can, and to make uſe of Gods appointed means to help them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they will be ſure of the aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit to carry the work through. For God <hi>will give the Holy Spirit to thoſe that ask him.</hi> Luke 11.13. and <hi>will work in them to will and to do well, while they are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56474:55"/>out their own Salvation</hi> by their endeavours, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. To him that hath a heart thus to begin well in uſing his firſt Talents which he hath from God, <hi>to him more ſhall be given by the Spirit of God, and he ſhall have abundance,</hi> Mat. 25.29.</p>
               <p>This kind of Righteouſneſs which we call Evangelical, is mentioned in Scripture under ſeveral forms of ſpeech, yet all ſignifying the ſame thing in the main, to wit, the truth and reality of Grace in the ſight of God. <hi>It is called unfeigned Faith, godly Sincerity, holineſs of Truth, a labouring to have always a Conſcience void of offence toward God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men, uprightneſs of Heart, truth in the inward parts, integrity, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart,</hi> and the like. And when we find in Scripture the promiſes of Pardon and Salvation made to Faith, repentance and obedience <hi>indefinitely,</hi> I think we may ſafely conclude, they are made to ſuch in whom theſe are realy and indeed, though but in the loweſt degree of ſincerity; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56474:56"/>ſequently that ſuch are in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Righteous perſons.</p>
               <p>But then though the truth and ſincerity of Grace in the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, will denominate thoſe that have it, Righteous men, yet that which is truly ſuch, how weak ſoever it be in the beginning, is of <hi>a growing</hi> nature. And the reaſon hereof is evident, becauſe where men do their beſt endeavours from time to time; uſe and exerciſe will make them more and more perfect in their way; the repetition of acts firſt begetting and then increaſing habits, and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether tending to more and more perfection in the Chriſtian courſe. Juſt as it is with perſons in their learning any Art or Trade: <hi>though the beginning be but ſmall, yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end will greatly increaſe;</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that in <hi>Job.</hi> The Divine Principle of Grace, which is <hi>the ſeed of God</hi> in the Soul, which brings forth the Harveſt of a good Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the nature of it contrary to fleſhly luſts, will be ſtill heaving at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56474:56"/>them to extirpate and drive them out, and aſpiring after a perfect ſtate in holineſs, hungering and thirſting after Righteouſneſs, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>the way of the Juſt is as the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18.</p>
               <p>By the way then let it be obſerved how eaſie the Yoke of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is, and how light his Burden, when he hath made the condition of obtaining the pardon of ſin and Eternal Life, no harder than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that we have been in Rebellion againſt our Maker to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and ſeriouſly to reſolve and ſincerely to endeavour to deſiſt from all acts of diſobedience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to do the beſt we can to pleaſe him in obſerving thoſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Laws of his Kingdom and Government, that are ordained for our own good, for the peace and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our own minds, for the preſervation of the health of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and for the innocent injoyments of other the comforts of this life: for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56474:57"/>the peace likewiſe, order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of publick Communities of men both in Church and State, while every one is thereby ordered to keep his own rank and to act in his own Sphere; and to prepare us by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them, for the enjoyment of a bleſſed immortality after all this: And likewiſe obſerve how unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and void of all judgment and diſcretion it is for men to deprive themſelves of all theſe advantages, and wilfully and deſperately to run upon their own ruin, when all might ſo eaſily be prevented, as by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to the eaſie Yoke and gentle Government of Chriſt, who reckons our hearty and ſincere endeavours in obeying him, for obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How this Righteouſneſs comes to be ſuch; to be accounted and accepted for Righteouſneſs: and it is ſo upon a double account at leaſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that it is ſo, it is by way of donation or free gift, without conſideration had of any
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56474:57"/>thing in us that ſhould render us worthy of ſuch a favour but the contrary. It doth not make the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit the leſs of Grace to us, in that it is beſtowed on us through Chriſt, or for his ſake; nor the leſs of Grace in God, becauſe the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt his obedient ſuffering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account whereof this gift or grant is made us, was the effect of Gods gratious deſign of benefit unto us: <hi>It was by the grace of God that he taſted death for every man,</hi> as we are told, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and conſequently all the good that does accrue to us by it, muſt be of Grace.</p>
               <p>That the introduction of this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs we ſpeak of, was of meer <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>free gift,</hi> appears <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. where this effect of Gods Grace is called <hi>the gift of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And in that Verſe and in the Verſe before and after, it is called the gift or free gift no leſs than four times. <hi>Not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one unto condemnation; but the free gift
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56474:58"/>was of many offences unto juſtification. For if by one mans offence death reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one; much more they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abundance of Grace and of the gift of Righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto the juſtification of life.</hi> And in verſ. 21. <hi>Grace is ſaid to reign through Righteouſneſs to life, as ſin had reigned unto death.</hi> In theſe Verſes St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews, that if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Adam</hi> were of force to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve his whole Race in condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that then the Grace of God and the gift by Grace through Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and upon account of his Righteouſneſs, will be much more available to the juſtification and pardon of all men, upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they receive this gift of being Righteous with that Righteouſneſs. And let it be noted, that the <hi>free gift</hi> here mentioned, and the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are not the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56474:58"/>ſame, but the one the effect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it is by the Righteouſneſs of one Chriſt Jeſus, that the free gift of Righteouſneſs came upon all men unto juſtification of life. That is as I conceive, this free gift of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men Righteous, if they receive it upon the terms of the giver, is granted unto all men otherwiſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, upon the account of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, Rom. 3.24. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified freely by his Grace through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here alſo we ſee that it is of free Grace that God approves of men as Juſt and does adjudg them Righteous, which is his Juſtifying of them: it is freely of Grace though it be through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus or for the ſake of his Mediatory obedience, Tit. 3.6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by his Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And when this Righteouſneſs of Faith is ſaid as it is, to be a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs <hi>imputed</hi> or a Righteouſneſs that is <hi>accounted</hi> for ſuch, it implies, nay argues, that it is ſo in a way
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56474:59"/>of grace and favour, and not in ſtirct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of juſtice. As on the contrary not to impute ſin when ſin hath been committed, ſignifies to deal with ſuch perſons in a way of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and not according to the rigor of ſtrict juſtice. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. As not to impute our treſpaſſes to us when we repent of them and ſtrive againſt them, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are not without all ſin, is purely an act of grace and of high favour in God: even ſo for him to impute Righteouſneſs to us when we ſincerely endeavour to be Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, though otherwiſe we be not without all ſin, is an act of the ſame grace likewiſe. This Righteouſneſs of Faith, it is not a <hi>natural</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as <hi>Adams</hi> was while he kept his integrity, but it is ſo meerly in the account of grace and favour. It is a Righteouſneſs by Divine <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> not otherwiſe of it ſelf ſo: its being ſo depends upon the grace and good will of God that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it ſo to be, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56474:59"/>and to paſs in account for ſuch. For which reaſon I conceive it is frequently called the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> Rom. 1.17. and 3.21. 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.22. Phil. 3.9. as noting it to be a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>ordaining,</hi> proceeding from his <hi>Grace,</hi> in oppoſition to mens own Righteouſneſs, which is or is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited to be a Righteouſneſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and of it ſelf, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Jews fancied their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law to be. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved through faith; and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8. That is, it is by Grace, and by virtue of the donation of God, that we are ſaved by Faith or the Righteouſneſs of Faith, and that we have ſuch a Faith or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith to be ſaved by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is by the Goſpel or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith is <hi>revealed and conveyed</hi> to us for ſuch, and <hi>ſtated</hi> and ſettled for ſuch as by a Law. This way
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56474:60"/>of accounting men that have been and are ſinners, to be Righteous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their believing, is not known by any Natural Light, becauſe it is not a Natural Righteouſneſs, but is purely matter of <hi>ſupernatural Revelation,</hi> as it is in it ſelf ſupernatural Grace. I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, For therein is the Righteouſneſs of God revealed from Faith to Faith, as it is written the juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17, And again, <hi>Now is the Righteouſneſs of God manifeſted without the Law,</hi> to wit, by the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. It is by this Goſpel or Covenant, that Faith is ordained to be our Righteouſneſs, and ſettled for ſuch as by a Law, which therefore is called the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. And the Goſpel which conveys this Grace to us, is frequently called <hi>the Grace of God, the word of his Grace, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the Grace of God.</hi> Tit. 2.11. Acts 14.3. and 20.24.</p>
               <p>The Meſſias according to what was Propheſied, hath <hi>brought in</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56474:60"/>Righteouſneſs, by the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, the everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; which was not in the world after the fall, but by his bringing in, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p>By all this it appears; that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant operates to our Juſtification, as it gives being from God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Righteouſneſs, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Juſtification: it is that by which God doth <hi>inſtitute</hi> this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: for it is a Righteouſneſs by <hi>inſtitution</hi> and not naturally ſuch, as I have ſhewed. What it does in this kind, it does it by virtue of Gods deſignation of it to that Office, and not by its own innate virtue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick worth or merit.</p>
               <p>When I ſay this Righteouſneſs of Faith is not <hi>naturally</hi> and of it ſelf ſuch; I do not mean that thoſe fruits of the Spirit of which it doth conſiſt, have not in them the true nature of goodneſs and holineſs, for that they have; but that theſe are not in Righteous men themſelves
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56474:61"/>(that yet are Evangelically Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) without all <hi>mixture</hi> of that which deſerves not the name of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and goodneſs, nor they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unrighteouſneſs, antecedent to this, and before they had repented: and therefore is not ſuch a compleat Righteouſneſs as would hold mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure according to the ſtandard of the Law of innocency, if we were to be tried by that, to be Juſtified, or Condemned by that. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the beſt of us have cauſe with the Pſalmiſt to cry out and ſay, <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldſt work iniquity, O Lord who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Pſal. 130.3. It is indeed a growing Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is by degrees growing up towards a perfect ſtate: ſuch in whom it is, are <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> But before it is grown to this perfect ſtate, it is in the account of grace and by way of favour and for Chriſts ſake, accepted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God for ſuch Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as unto which he hath promiſed the pardon of all paſt offences, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56474:61"/>of all ſuch after infirmities as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this Covenant-Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in its lower degree, and alſo eternal Life it ſelf. So that in a word this thing we call everlaſting Righteouſneſs by which we are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, owes it ſelf its very being ſuch a Righteouſneſs as it is, unto the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, or that Grace of God and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is put into a Covenant for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant operates to our Juſtification, as being the <hi>rule</hi> by which thoſe are juſtified in judgment to be Righteous perſons, ſuch as to whom the promiſe of pardon and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is made, that are juſtified at all. Righteouſneſs as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, receives its denomination as it doth its nature, from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to ſome Law. And this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Righteouſneſs the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, receives its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from its Conformity to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, as being that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in the perſon, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which the promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56474:62"/>are made, and therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that is Juſtified, is Juſtified by this Law to be ſuch a perſon as to whom the promiſes are made. It is by this Law that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is Juſtified in his cauſe: if a man be not a Juſt and Righteous perſon in the ſenſe of this Law, he will not be Juſtified by God; for he judgeth of men and their cauſe by this Law. Jam. 2.12. <hi>So ſpeak ye and ſo do as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:</hi> that is the Goſpel or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judg you in the laſt day,</hi> John 12.48.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Covenant operates to our Juſtification, as an <hi>inſtrument</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us to become Righteous, and ſo capable ſubjects of Juſtification. And this it doth by way of motive or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion. The great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to men in this Covenant, of pardon of ſin and eternal Life, on condition of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs and not otherwiſe;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56474:62"/>they out of a deſire and love to the benefits promiſed, are perſuaded to imbrace the condition without which they cannot enjoy them, that is, to become Righteous. The Goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration is called <hi>the miniſtration of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.9. And it is ſo both as it miniſters to us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that there is another Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs than that which is of the Law, and alſo as it miniſters to us powerful motives and aſſiſtances to follow after Righteouſneſs, by which they become Righteous and ſo to be Juſtified. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation,</hi> in as much as therein <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.16, 17. the terms on which God will account them Righteous, and the motives to make them ſo, theſe are revealed by the Goſpel, by which it becomes the power of God to Salvation to thoſe that believe it. The Goſpel is a miniſtration of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and of Juſtification, as it is the miniſtration of Reconciliation, of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56474:63"/>reconciling us to God, of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our nature to the holy nature of God, and to his holy Laws, by making us partakers of a Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a God-like Nature, in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs, which is done by the great and precious promiſes of the Goſpel, of pardon and eternal Life, as powerful motives perſuading men to become new creatures in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining theſe great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits promiſed and attainable only upon condition of ſuch our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to God, which puts us into a perfect capacity of Juſtification, that is, of being approved of as thoſe who have performed the condition of the foreſaid promiſed benefits. Thus the Goſpel is called the <hi>word of reconciliation,</hi> which was committed to the Apoſtles and others, and their Miniſtry <hi>the miniſtry of reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18.19. And by a practical knowledg and belief of theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Goſpel, men come to be juſtified, that is, approved of as thoſe that have known, believed and obeyed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56474:63"/>the Goſpel. <hi>By his knowledg,</hi> ſaith God concerning Chriſt, <hi>ſhall my righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant juſtifie many,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. That is, by the knowledg of him in what he is, hath done and ſuffered, revealed and taught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh,</hi> as to <hi>free us from the Law of ſin,</hi> and to bring us to that Righteouſneſs which it did deſign but could not effect, that is now done by <hi>the Law of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to wit, the Goſpel. The Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Goſpel, could not give us that aſſurance of Gods willingneſs to be reconciled to us, and of pardon upon repentance, which the Goſpel does; much leſs of a glorious reward of new obedience. For the promiſe of pardon for Chriſts ſake upon our repentance, the promiſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body, and of the Celeſtial Glory, are brought to light by the Goſpel, being matters of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation. Now it is the great aſſurance which the Goſpel gives us of theſe things upon the account
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56474:64"/>of Chriſts death, that is the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive of prevailing with men to be reconciled to God and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Evangelically Righteous that they may be Juſtified. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the preaching of the Croſs,</hi> is ſaid to be to <hi>them that are ſaved, the power of God and for wiſdom of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.18, 24. That is, it contains and lays open Gods moſt wiſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of reconciling ſinners to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by that means becomes his powerful motive of drawing men to it, that ſo they may be Juſtified, Pardoned and Glorified: <hi>The Law made nothing perfect,</hi> it is the <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of this better hope</hi> by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that doth it. Heb. 7.19. The Law which laid a burden of ſtrict obedience upon men, backt with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatnings in caſe of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, prevailed little upon men, but to keep them under a ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to fear, while they were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rich grace and indulgence of the Goſpel, by which the Yoke of Chriſt is rendered eaſie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56474:64"/>and his burden light. The Goſpel prevails much more upon men when they heartily believe it, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming pardon to all repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and immenſe rewards to ſuch as ſhall with honeſt minds give up themſelves to Chriſt to be his Diſciples to learn of him by his Doctrine and Example, how to live a ſober, righteous and a godly Life: And by promiſing Divine aſſiſtance as well as vaſt rewards, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of honeſt and ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and by making allowances for ſuch frailties and defects both in knowledg and practice, as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with uprightneſs of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And thus I have ſhewn how the Goſpel operates to our Juſtification, as a great and effectual means of bringing us to become Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically Righteous, without which we cannot be Juſtified by having that Righteouſneſs imputed to us, and by being approved of as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous upon the account of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Faith and how that operates to our Juſtification.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>operate</hi> to our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> we are perfectly aſſured by the frequent and expreſs notice thereof we have from the Scriptures, ſuch as Rom. 3.30. and 5.1. Gal. 2.16. and others. And Faith operates to our Juſtification as it is the performance of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which the great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are made. For the Covenant conſiſts chiefly of two parts, to wit, the <hi>promiſes</hi> which God makes of beſtowing benefits on us through Chriſt, and of the <hi>condition</hi> upon which theſe promiſes are made; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſummarily compriſed in Faith or believing.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed further to ſpeak of Faith, I think it not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56474:65"/>here to premiſe to what is to be ſaid about Faith, as the condition of the Goſpel-Covenant, ſomwhat to ſhew that the promiſes of pardon and eternal Life, are <hi>conditional.</hi> The Goſpel-Covenant is directly ſuited to that Mediatory undertaking of Chriſt, by which the Covenant it ſelf was obtained, and on which it was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now I have ſhewed formerly, that Chriſt died for all men indeed, but yet it was but to obtain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional pardon for all men, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits conſequent upon it. He did not die to procure that God ſhould be reconciled to them that ſhould always refuſe to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him, but to obtain their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reſtauration to the favour of God, upon condition of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded to be reconciled to him. And truly the Covenant of Grace holds an exact proportion to the Covenant of Redemption or Law of Mediation, by the fulfilling of which by Chriſt, the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as I ſaid, was obtained. As
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56474:66"/>our Saviour died for all, to put all into a capacity of being pardoned and ſaved, in caſe they ſhould not perſiſt finally in rebellion againſt God, ſo the Covenant of Grace promiſeth pardon and ſalvation, juſt upon the ſame terms and not otherwiſe. For the Goſpel denounceth a being <hi>puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power,</hi> againſt all thoſe that <hi>know not God and which obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that when we compare the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and threatnings in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel together, we are put upon a neceſſity of underſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in a conditional ſenſe, otherwiſe the promiſe and threatning would be inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>And indeed the promiſe of thoſe great benefits, ſeldom if ever are found without the condition annexed, either expreſly or by plain intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The gracious declaration of the Goſpel runs thus. <hi>And you that were ſomtime alienated and enemies in your
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56474:66"/>minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death, to preſent you holy and unblamable and unreproveable in his ſight,</hi> [if] <hi>ye continue in the Faith grounded and ſettled; and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel.</hi> Col. 1.21, 22, 23. <hi>If</hi> ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: but <hi>if</hi> ye through ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live, Rom. 8.13. <hi>If</hi> ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you: but <hi>if</hi> ye forgive not men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your treſpaſſes. Mat. 6.14, 15. <hi>If</hi> we walk in the light as he is in the light, then have we fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 John 1.7. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional particles [if] plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the conditional nature of the promiſes, yea, and of the threatnings too. The promiſes are not made to ſuch or ſuch men by name, but to all men under ſuch or ſuch a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56474:67"/>as to thoſe that believe, to thoſe that repent, to thoſe that obey the truth. Which qualification ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies the condition on which, and ſo the perſons to which ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belong. This is a thing ſo plain throughout the Scripture from end to end, that more need not be ſaid of it.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed thus much, I ſhall now proceed to ſhew how Faith operates to our Juſtification: and in order to our better underſtanding what influence Faith hath in our Juſtification, we will enquire into theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How it appears that Faith is the condition of the promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What that Faith is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why it is made the condition of the promiſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In what capacity men are to perform that condition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How more particularly it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to our Juſtification.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56474:67"/>
               <p n="1">1. That Faith is the <hi>condition</hi> on which pardon of ſin and eternal Life are promiſed in the Goſpel, is ſo plain that nothing more need to be ſaid to make it evident, than only to point to the expreſs letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in this caſe. For pardon of ſin; this is promiſed on condition of believing, Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believes in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And ſo is eternal Life promiſed on the ſame terms, John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſtiug Life.</hi> If theſe promiſes are made to believers as ſuch, as we ſee they are, then believing muſt needs be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which they are made. This is paſt contradiction, Jo. 3.36. Acts 16.31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider we next then, what that Faith or believing is which is the condition on which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed benefits, remiſſion of ſin and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56474:68"/>eternal Life are ſuſpended. And without all doubt it is not only a ſpeculative, but a practical belief: It is a hearty aſſent of the mind to the truth of the Goſpel, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere conſent in the will to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws and Precepts of it. The ſame thing, the ſame Faith for ſubſtance, is in Scripture deſcribed by different Phraſes. Somtimes it is deſcribed by a <hi>believing the record of God concerning his Son Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 John 5.10, 11. Somtimes by <hi>a believing Jeſus to be the Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> John 20.31. 1 John 5.1.5. And ſomtimes <hi>by a believing of the Goſpel, a believing of the truth, a believing of the teſtimony of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> of our Saviour, Mark 16.15, 16. 2 Theſ. 1.10. and 2.13.</p>
               <p>And it is no marvail the ſame Faith ſhould be thus diverſly expreſt, ſince a believing of any one of theſe, includes in it a belief of them all, and ſo does a belief of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, by which this Faith is alſo ſomtimes deſcribed, Rom. 10.9.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56474:68"/>For he that believes the Record of God concerning Chriſt, cannot but believe him to be the Son of God, becauſe that is the thing which the Father Almighty hath more than once teſtified by a voice from Heaven Mat. 3.17. and 17.5. And he who believes Chriſt to be the Son of God, muſt needs believe his doctrine, which is the Goſpel, to be true. As on the other hand, whoever believes the Goſpel, muſt needs believe Chriſt to be the Son of God, becauſe it teſtifies ſo much of him; and likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſets forth thoſe many ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Miracles which he wrought, and how the ancient predictions of the Prophets concerning the Meſſias were fulfilled in him, and alſo his Miraculous Reſurrection from the dead: by all which he is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Now then whoſoever rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the doctrine of our Saviour contained in the Goſpel, and of his Apoſtles concerning him, do believe that he died for our ſins and roſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56474:69"/>again, and that repentance or amend ment of life and obedience to the Precepts of our Saviour, are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſibly neceſſary to the obtaining of remiſſion of ſin and eternal Life by his Death, Reſurrection and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe theſe things are declared to be ſo in that Goſpel which is ſo believed. And therefore whoſoever does believe he ſhall be ſaved by Chriſts death from the wrath to come, though he does not truly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely make it his buſineſs to amend his life according to the Precepts of our Saviour, believes not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but believes that which is a flat contradiction to it, and is like thoſe of whom the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> Tit. 1.16.</p>
               <p>Or if any man ſhould believe this amendment of life to be neceſſary to the obtaining Remiſſion of ſin and Salvation by the death of Chriſt: Yet what would this belief avail him, if he himſelf ſhould not by this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56474:69"/>belief become a new man in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, righteouſneſs, and ſobriety of living? It is not any mans believing the moſt important and concerning truth, that will avail him before God, further than it tends to make him better, to make him a good man. The Devils we find confeſſed Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>thou art Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> Luke 4.41. the ſame form of words almoſt <hi>verbatim,</hi> in which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Saviour made confeſſion of their Faith, John 6.69. And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> Chap. 2.19. But what are they the better for it, ſo long as they retain the ſame deviliſh nature which they had before? Nor can we ſay that mens Faith will any more ſave them than the Devils Faith ſaves Devils, whatever it is which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, unleſs that belief makes them better men in heart and Life. If a man believe aright and underſtands what it is he believes, he can hardly be any more careleſs of acting according to his belief, than he is careleſs of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56474:70"/>the pardon of his ſin and the Salvation of his Soul.</p>
               <p>A right ſaving belief of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel then, hath in it the ſpirit and ſeed of a good life: it hath in it virtually and <hi>potentially,</hi> all pious and vertuous actions. And all pious and vertuous actions that proceed from Faith, are as I may ſo ſay, but Faith diverſified in ſeveral acts, and are a part of Faith, as the fruit that grows upon a Tree, is part of the Tree. And to make this appear in ſome inſtances; all thoſe noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous acts of the Patriarchs and other Worthies mentioned in Hebrews the 11th. Chapter, did all grow out of their Faith, for by Faith they did them all. All the good report which they obtained upon account of their Heroick actions, is attributed to their Faith by which they did atchieve them: <hi>theſe all having obtained a good report through Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 39.</p>
               <p>More particularly, the Author of this Epiſtle to the Hebrews in Ver. 5. of this 11th. Chapter proves that it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56474:70"/>was by Faith that <hi>Enoch</hi> was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, becauſe he had this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that before he was tranſlated he pleaſed God (or walked with God, as his Hiſtory relates it, Gen. 5.) which as he ſhews was impoſſible for him to have done, if he had not had Faith: for ſaith he, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> So that we ſee the ſame thing is attributed to the Righteouſneſs of his life in walking with God, as is to his Faith which produced that effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that thereby he pleaſed God. And ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> Ver. 7. that <hi>by faith he being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe,</hi> by which action of his in conjunction with his Faith, <hi>he became heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo, Ver. 17. <hi>that by Faith he offered up</hi> Iſaac. And it is ſaid by St. <hi>James</hi> that by this good work of his, the fruit of his Faith among others, he <hi>was Juſtified,</hi> Jam. 2.21. And not only ſo, but that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56474:71"/>
                  <hi>therein the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith,</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Ver. 23. which ſhews that when the Scripture ſaith, Gen. 15.6. that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> believing God was counted to him for Righteouſneſs, it was meant of his Faith as it was a vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſincere obedience to God in whatever he commanded him, elſe that Scripture would not have been fulfilled in <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in his being juſtified thereby as well as by his Faith. The like is ſaid of <hi>Rahab, that by faith ſhe peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not with them that believed not, when ſhe had received the ſpies in peace,</hi> Heb. 11.31. And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, that ſhe was Juſtified by this work which was the fruit of her Faith, Jam. 2.25. So that we ſee in the Scripture-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, to have Faith counted to us for Righteouſneſs, and to have acts of obedience proceeding from Faith to be counted for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in conjunction with the Faith it ſelf, is the ſame thing. And to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56474:71"/>by Faith, and to be Juſtified by thoſe acts of obedience which are the iſſue of Faith in conjunction with the Faith it ſelf, is ſtill the ſame thing in the ſenſe of holy Scripture. All this is to ſhew what and what manner of Faith it is that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on the which pardon of ſin and eternal Life are promiſed in the Goſpel-Covenant, and by which we are Juſtified, and which is counted for Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And for our greater confirmation in this, and to ſhew further that no Faith can entitle us to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant, the promiſe of pardon and the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, but ſuch a practical Faith as I have deſcribed, conſider theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If none can be pardoned but ſuch as repent, nor ſee the Kingdom of God, except they be born again, as the Scripture aſſures us they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: then no Faith can entitle us to Pardon and Salvation, as it is a fulfilling the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56474:72"/>of the Covenant, but ſuch as is a penitential regenerating Faith, ſuch as works repentance and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in men, nor till it hath wrought theſe effects at leaſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. I cannot imagine what can be ſaid with any ſhew of reaſon againſt this argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. St. <hi>James</hi> argues, that Faith which hath not works cannot ſave, Ver. 12. and concludes his reaſoning, Ver. 24. with ſaying, <hi>Ye ſee then how that by Works a man is Juſtified, and not by Faith only,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith and Obedience are ſo much the ſame, or at leaſt ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable when ſaving, as that the ſame Greek word is indifferently tranſlated to <hi>believe</hi> or to <hi>obey:</hi> and ſo on the contrary the ſame word is tranſlated <hi>unbelief</hi> or <hi>diſobedience.</hi> Inſtances of this nature you have in Acts 5.36. Rom. 11.30, 31. Epheſ. 5.6. Heb. 4.11. and 11.31. in all which you have the ſame word tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated one way in the line reading, and another in the margin. And <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56474:72"/>and <hi>diſobedience</hi> are likewiſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to each other as contraries, as well as <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>unbelief</hi> are, and as well as <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>diſobedience</hi> are, as you may ſee for inſtance, in Rom. 10.16. 1 Pet. 2.7. 2 Theſ. 2.12. By all which we may reaſonably judg, that when Faith only is mentioned as the condition on which pardon and eternal Life are promiſed, yet then it is to be underſtood of a practical obediential Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſame benefits, pardon of ſin and eternal Life, are promiſed upon the condition of obedience in ſome Scriptures, which are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on condition of believing in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As for inſtance, <hi>If we walk in the light as he is in the light,</hi> we have fellowſhip one with another, <hi>and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1.7. Here aſſurance is given us of being purged from the guilt of ſin by the blood of Chriſt, in caſe we walk in the light as God is in the light, labouring to be holy as God is holy,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56474:73"/>in all manner of converſation. And <hi>Chriſt is the Author of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all them that obey him.</hi> Heb. 5.9. And <hi>bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter through the gates into the City,</hi> Revel. 22.14. <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 7.21. Now if holy obedience be made the condition of the promiſe of Pardon and Life, as well as Faith, as we ſee it is, then none but an obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Faith, can be a performance of the condition of that promiſe. By an obediential Faith, I mean ſuch a Faith as by which a man is moved and inclined, and in ſome ſort ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do what is his preſent duty, ſo far as he underſtands it to be ſo. And in this ſenſe a mans Faith and his obedience are of the ſame date, and commence together. And therefore it is no marvel that the ſame promiſe of the ſame benefits is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56474:73"/>made to the one which is made to the other, and that both are joyned in the condition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In Heb. 8.10, 11, 12. where we have the tenour of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant declared, God promiſeth to be a God only to ſuch, and to forgive the iniquities only of ſuch as have his Law put into their minds and written in their hearts. Where <hi>Faith</hi> is not at all mentioned as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of receiving thoſe benefits, but the having the <hi>Law written in the heart.</hi> Though the having the Law written in the heart ſuppoſeth Faith, I grant, as a productive cauſe of it, yet we ſee it is not the condition of the promiſed benefits, otherwiſe than as it produceth ſuch an effect, which effect is only here mentioned, and not Faith which is the cauſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When ſaving Faith is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the nature of its operation upon a man himſelf, and not only as it acteth upon its object without him, then we are told <hi>it purifieth the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. <hi>worketh by love,</hi> Gal.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56474:74"/>5.6. <hi>overcometh the world,</hi> 1 John 5.4. and <hi>ſanctifieth the whole man,</hi> Acts 26.18. And therefore we have no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think Faith is a fulfilling the condition of the promiſe only as it acteth upon its object by way of credence or aſſent, or affiance either, without its transforming operation upon the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next thing to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, is the reaſon why Faith is made the condition of the promiſes of the Goſpel-Covenant. And the reaſons hereof ſeem to be ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith is made the <hi>condition</hi> of the promiſe, that it might appear to be of <hi>grace</hi> that ſuch promiſe is made, and made upon ſuch a condition as <hi>faith</hi> is. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſpoken of the promiſe being made through the Righteouſneſs of Faith, and not through the Righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. He gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, Verſe 16. when he ſays, <hi>It is therefore of Faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56474:74"/>be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the Faith of</hi> Abraham. In which words we have a general reaſon why Faith is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promiſe, and that is, that it might be by Grace. And another is given in a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</p>
               <p>There is a double reaſon why it muſt needs be of Grace that the great Promiſes of the Goſpel are made to mens believing the Goſpel. The one is taken from the nature of the thing, that is, of Faith it ſelf in reference and relation to its object. For he that believes the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that the great bleſſings and benefits promiſed therein, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed not for any merit of his to whom they are promiſed, but for the ſake of another, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>whom God hath ſet forth for a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. And he that believes the Goſpel according to what it reveals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56474:75"/>alſo that it was of Grace that he was thus made a propitiation: for it <hi>was by the Grace of God that he taſted death for every man.</hi> Heb. 2.9. <hi>Not by works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Tit. 3.5. And whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves all this, exalts the grace of God in ſo believing. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who believed and taught this in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the misbelieving Jews, who thought to be juſtified by the works of the Law, without the death of the Meſſias to obtain that and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits, ſaid, <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God; for if righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> Gal. 2.21. Thus he by his Faith and Doctrine, according to it, in believing and teaching Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, did not fruſtrate but <hi>exalt</hi> the grace of God. Faith then in the very nature of it, does own the promiſe of all benefits to be of Grace, when made to ſuch as by ſin had forfeited all.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:56474:75"/>
               <p>The other reaſon why it muſt needs be of Grace that the Promiſe is made upon condition of Faith, is this; becauſe our believing that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to wit, Chriſt, hath by his own ſuffering, and interceſſion for us, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon and life upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our being reconciled to God, cannot without believing a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be thought to merit theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; but that the Promiſe and the benefits promiſed, and their being promiſed on ſuch a condition as an obediential Faith is, muſt needs be all of Grace, and cuts off all occaſion of boaſting; For Chriſt is made to us of God, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption, <hi>to the end that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30, 31. And it is <hi>by grace that we are ſaved through faith; and not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8, 9. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded, by what Law? Of works? Nay but by the Law of faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:56474:76"/>
               <p>Again, the Promiſe is therefore of Faith that it might be by Grace, <hi>to the end that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> as well of the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion as of the Circumciſion. The Promiſe of Pardon and Life to the Gentiles the greateſt ſinners, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of repentance, is ſecured and made ſure to them by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, becauſe the Promiſe ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, is founded in the death of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom all the promiſes are Yea and <hi>Amen.</hi> For no man can with the leaſt appearance of reaſon imagine that the great God would ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one ſo great and ſo greatly beloved by him as his holy Son is, to ſuch ſufferings as he underwent to procure Pardon and Life for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners, were he not fully and perfectly reſolved to Pardon and ſave them upon their repentance, notwithſtanding all their ſins they were guilty of before, how hainous ſoever they may have been. Upon which account our Saviour thus given by the Father to ſuch an end, is ſaid
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56474:76"/>to be <hi>ſurety of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. that is, he is the great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the great God hath given to the world of performing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath promiſed us upon his Sons account in that Covenant. <hi>God that ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.31. And now who ſees not but that this is an act of exceeding rich Grace in God, not only to reſolve to beſtow upon the children of men ſuch great things as he hath promiſed, but alſo to give them ſuch a ſecurity for it as he hath done, by giving his Son to prepare the way for it?</p>
               <p>Now the ſenſe and comfort of all this Grace, and ſo our aſcribing the glory of it unto God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, depends upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving theſe things. And therefore God hath entailed the Promiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits upon that Faith as a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which we can have no ſenſe of all that grace of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56474:77"/>in the Promiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well might the Apoſtle ſay, It is therefore of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Promiſe appears to be of <hi>grace</hi> in reference to the <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> on which it is made, whether we conſider the vaſt diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the things promiſed and the condition on which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; or the eaſineſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it ſelf. Conſidering what by ſin we have deſerved; it would have been matter of Grace in God and great Grace too, if he had promiſed us no more but a deliverance from the wrath to come, and that upon any poſſible condition, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe never ſo rigorous or hard to have been performed; as ſuppoſe it had been the greateſt ſeverity the nature of man could undergo, to be exerciſed by us on our own bodies. If this had been the caſe, yet herein there would have been as much grace and favour ſhewed us, as ſuch tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56474:77"/>ſeverities would come ſhort of eternal torments in Hell. And if this would have been matter of grace, as moſt certain it would; how much more doth it appear to be ſo, when God hath promiſed not only exemption from the vengeance of eternal fire, but alſo to exalt our nature and to prefer us to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal happineſs and glory, far greater probably, than the happineſs of an earthly Paradiſe would have been, in caſe we had never ſinned at all; and yet all this too upon ſo eaſie a condition as Faith is. For eaſie it is in the attaining to it, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what proviſion God hath made, and what aſſiſtances he is ready to afford, to enable us to believe. And it's eaſie in its exerciſe and work, if we conſider what we are to do by vertue of it, which beſides affiance in God and our Saviour, is but to abſtain from that we had better be without than have, though we ſhould not be concerned in a future ſtate in another world; and to do no more,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56474:78"/>but what tends to the perfecting of our nature and the comfort of our lives, beſides the future glory; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the caſe of perſecution for Righteouſneſs ſake. In ſuch reſpects as theſe I have mentioned, it plainly appears that Gods making of Faith to be the condition upon which his great benefits are promiſed us, tends greatly to manifeſt the grace of God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to fill us with a ſenſe of it, for which cauſe we ſee he hath choſen it to that office of being the condition of pardon of ſin and eternal Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>And one reaſon why God would have his own grace ſo manifeſt in all theſe his proceedings and dealings with us, and why he would have us poſſeſſed with ſo great a ſenſe of it, is I conceive, becauſe he knows this is the direct way of reconciling us to himſelf, of making us to have good and honourable thoughts of him, ſuch as incline and diſpoſe us to be reconciled to him. And this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56474:78"/>brings me to another reaſon why Faith is made the condition of the great and precious promiſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which is this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a Faith as I have deſcribed, does beſt accommodate Gods deſign of Grace towards us in reconciling us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our happineſs; which may be another reaſon why Faith is made the condition of the promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. There is a certain <hi>aptitude</hi> in Faith to reconcile us to God and to produce that in us which is the matter of our Juſtification, as well as of our reconciliation to God. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the motives by which men come to be perſuaded to be reconciled to God, receive their <hi>ſtrength from Faith</hi> in one reſpect, as they do from the goodneſs of the nature of God and his veracity in another.</p>
               <p>I have intimated before that it is from an apprehenſion which men have of Gods willingneſs to be reconciled to them, that inclines them to be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56474:79"/>reconciled to him. While men look upon God as a reſolved irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy to them; well they may dread him as the Devils do, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love him nor be reconciled to him, no more perhaps than the Devils can. All the good thoughts of God, as of one that delights not in our deſtruction, but concerns himſelf for our ſalvation, and which any way incline us to be reconciled to him, take their riſe from thoſe declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God hath made to us of his willingneſs and deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us upon ſuppoſition of our willingneſs to be reconciled to him. Hence it is that we are ſaid to <hi>love God, becauſe he firſt loved us</hi> (1 John 4.19.) <hi>and to be reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God thereby commended his love to us while we were yet ſinners, and gave us an ample and full proof of his willingneſs to be reconciled to us, as making way thereby for it, Rom. 5.8, 9, 10. And thus <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56474:79"/>by aſſuring us of a readineſs in him to be reconciled to us, and not to impute to us our treſpaſſes; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſtill that we refuſe not to be reconciled to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. By this declared willingneſs in God to be reconciled to us, and by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared reſolution not only to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, but alſo to exalt us in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory, provided we refuſe not to be reconciled to him, but to puniſh us as obſtinate rebels and irreconcileable enemies, if we do: I ſay it is by theſe motives that men are perſuaded and prevailed withal to be reconciled to God; or to his nature, as when they become pleaſed with the ſame things which pleaſe him, and diſpleaſed with what is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him: and to his Law and Government, as when they conſent to the wiſdom and goodneſs thereof, and accordingly ſubmit to it as beſt.</p>
               <p>But then it is by means of <hi>Faith</hi> that theſe <hi>motives</hi> do <hi>affect</hi> us and operate to our reconciliation to God. There is no other way to affect the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56474:80"/>ſoul with all the great things which God and Chriſt have done for us, and conditionally promiſed to us, but by means of this Faith. For we do not know that Chriſt is the Son of God, or for what end he died, nor that God will both pardon and give eternal Life to ſinners upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being reconciled to him, but by Divine Revelation: which Divine Revelation doth not affect us or <hi>operate</hi> upon us, further than it is <hi>believed.</hi> Theſe motives not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible objects, have no being in the ſoul and ſo no operation, till Faith give them a being there, by giving credit to that doctrine by which they are Revealed. For <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance or confidence of things hoped for, and the evidence or convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>We know and believe the love that God hath to us,</hi> 1 John 4.16.</p>
               <p>Faith, it is the great inſtrument of reconciling us to God, both as it acts upon its object, and as it acts upon its ſubject. Divine Revelation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56474:80"/>is its object, and by crediting that, the foreſaid motives are received into the ſoul as real things. And then Faith acts upon its ſubject, the ſoul it ſelf in which Faith dwells, by fixing the foreſaid motives in the mind and working them into the will, by which the work of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and converſion unto God is wrought and brought about. In this way or in this reſpect, love to God, obedience to his Precepts, and all divine virtues and holineſs of Life, flow from Faith. And therefore it's no marvel that Faith is mentioned in Scripture as the <hi>ſummary</hi> condition on which the Promiſes of the Goſpel are made. Hence we may ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſanctification is attributed to Faith, as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and more particularly the purity of the heart, love to God and men, and victory over the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. Yea the whole of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs of Godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity both in heart and life, ſo often ſtiled the Righteouſneſs of God, is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56474:81"/>ſaid to be by Faith, as the next and immediate productive cauſe of it, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the operation of the Spirit of God,</hi> Phil. 3.9. Rom. 3.22. This Faith therefore having ſuch an aptitude in it as I have ſhewed, to reconcile us unto God by renewing our nature and conforming us to him, without which Faith we could not by the great and precious promiſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, be made partakers of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, we may ſee reaſon enough why it is made the condition of the promiſes of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By <hi>affiance</hi> in God and in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is one ſpecial act of Faith, we give and aſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as much as in us lies, the glory of his attributes and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his nature, his truth and faithfulneſs, power, wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: which may be another reaſon why this honour is by God put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Faith, ſo as to be accounted to us for Righteouſneſs, and to be made the condition of Gods making good to us the great promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56474:81"/>forgiveneſs of ſin and eternal Life. By this <hi>affiance</hi> we venture our ſelves ſoul and body, and our whole concern for all eternity, upon the truth of Gods word and promiſe, upon his faithfulneſs and power to perform it, and upon the all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt Jeſus to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Redeemer, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves and the conduct of our lives wholly to his Rule and Government, out of a confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of having Gods promiſe made good to us, and of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and prevalency of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours performance for us. This truſt and confidence, God is pleaſed to take as ſuch a piece of honour done to him, as that the Scripture calls our <hi>receiving Gods teſtimony, a ſetting to our ſeal that God is true,</hi> John 3.33. a juſtifying of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the jealouſies and ſuſpitions of men, and the reproach which their unbelief caſts upon God, Luke 7.29. <hi>For he that believeth not the record which God hath given of his Son,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56474:82"/>hath made him a lier,</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>Thus</hi> Abraham <hi>gave glory to God when he ſtaggered not at his promiſe through unbelief, but was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that what he had promiſed he was able alſo to perform,</hi> Rom. 4.20, 21. And in that he did thus give glory to God in believing, this in the next words is given as the reaſon why his Faith was <hi>imputed</hi> to him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Ver. 22. And thus we ſee that God is pleaſed to honour that moſt in men, to wit, their Faith, by which they moſt honour him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In what capacity thoſe under the Goſpel are, to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe by believing. For Faith is mans act, what ever the aſſiſtances are by which he is enabled to perform it. With the heart <hi>man believeth</hi> unto Righteouſneſs, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10.10. For our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding in what capacity men are of believing, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſider, 1. What God
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56474:82"/>hath done towards the working of Faith in men, antedecent to the act of believing. 2. What man himſelf can do through the antecedent Grace of God, towards his believing. 3. What ſubſequent Grace God does and will vouchſafe for the perfecting the work of Faith, and carrying it quite through, unto ſuch as do not groſly neglect to do what they may and well can do, towards their own believing, by uſing and improving the antecedent Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which God hath done towards the raiſing of Faith in men antecedent to any act of Faith in them, or of any endeavours of theirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch a thing, is his vouchſafing unto them the Goſpel, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its Divinity, and by it to reveal to them the things which are to be believed. And this we call the objective Grace of God as well as the antecedent; and is that alſo which we call preventive Grace. And in theſe reſpects the Goſpel is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtiled the Grace of God, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56474:83"/>ſomtimes the Faith: for it is both the object of Faith, and a means to raiſe it in men: For Faith comes by hearing it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. In reſpect of this preventive antecedent Grace, God is ſaid to have offered Faith to all men (ſo it is in the margent) in that he hath raiſed Chriſt from the dead; that is, to all to whom this is revealed by the Goſpel, Acts 17.31. By this Revelation God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto all ſuch as to whom it comes, means by which they may come to believe, if they be not greatly wanting to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider we next what men themſelves can do towards the raiſing of this Faith in them by means of this antecedent objective Grace of God. 1. They can hear this Goſpel as well as any other ſubject of diſcourſe which is offered to their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this is one ſtep towards their believing of it; for Faith comes by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. 2. They can conſider the things they hear from it, and that's another ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56474:83"/>believing. Thus the <hi>Bereans</hi> by conſidering of and ſearching into the things they heard, came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Acts 17.11, 12. They can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether they have not immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls to take care of as well as mortal bodies, and whether there be not a future ſtate after this life: for of ſuch things as theſe the Goſpel treats. They can conſider of ſuch reaſons when they hear them, as tend to ſatisfie the mind and reaſon of man, that there is ſuch a future ſtate. For Heathens by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without the Revelation of the Goſpel, came ſo far as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of ſuch a thing. And when by conſidering they come to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded either that there is ſuch a future ſtate, or that it's far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that there is than that there is not, then they can hardly forbear to conſider and think more or leſs, what is like to become of them in that future ſtate. And upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that they are perſuaded in their own minds that there is ſuch a future
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56474:84"/>ſtate, they can no more put off a deſire of being happy in it, than they can put off nature it ſelf and ceaſe to be men. They can diſcern a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between moral good, and evil in very many things, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tendency of them to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery in the future ſtate. They cannot, though they would, think that evil tends to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and good to the miſery of that future ſtate, but the contrary. They can conſider and think on ſuch things as by which the Holy Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to this happineſs, as well as they can the Contents of other Books. Before men have debauched their natures by a cuſtom of ſinning, there is hardly any but have ſome ſuch thoughts as theſe ſpring up more or leſs in their minds. And to what degree they do ſo, they have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bring men to a belief of the Goſpel, and a good life, as I ſhall further ſhew afterwards,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſubſequent Grace of God and work of the Holy Spirit, is that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56474:84"/>by which the former conſiderations which had ſome tendency to Faith, are heightned, improved and carried on until ſuch a Faith is produced in the ſoul, as is a believing unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And this ſeems to be done chiefly in ſome ſuch way as this. Firſt by preſenting the objective Grace of God (the Goſpel) more frequently to their conſideration, and by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their thoughts more intently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great and concerning matters contained therein, Secondly, by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intellective faculties of the ſoul by more frequent and repeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to underſtand and diſcern the nature and import of the great doctrines of the Goſpel, as containing Gods deſign of wiſdom and goodneſs for the recovery of loſt men from ſin and deſtruction for ſin, by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And by this means a greater light breaks into the ſoul, by which the evidence of the truth of what the Goſpel reports, is better diſcerned than it was before, and ſo are a mans own great concerns for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56474:85"/>which are therein laid open. And thereby alſo is the mind prevailed upon to aſſent to the truth of our Saviours doctrine in the Goſpel, and the will to conſent to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the great concerns of a mans ſoul. And therefore mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is in Scripture, deſcribed by their being turned from darkneſs to light, by their being enlightned, and having the eyes of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, and the like.</p>
               <p>And ſomtimes this work of Faith or Grace in the ſoul, is aſcribed to the former work of God upon the mind, <hi>viz.</hi> the holding the mind and thoughts unto a more cloſe, ſerious and intent conſideration of the great things of the Goſpel, and a mans own great concerns therein. Thus in Jam. 1.25. <hi>Whoſo looketh into the perfect Law of liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues therein</hi> (i.e. <hi>continues looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it) he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> Here we ſee one that continues his looking into
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56474:85"/>the doctrine of the Goſpel (which is meant by the Law of Liberty) and a forgetful hearer are oppoſed to each other, and ſo is a forgetful hearer and a doer of the work. By which it plainly appears, that the reaſon why the ones hearing ends in the doing of the work, and in being bleſſed in his deed, and the other does not, is for that the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders and continues from time to time ſeriouſly to conſider the weight and importance of what he hears, and of his own great concern in it; but the other does not, but is a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearer; as little minds it, as if he were not concerned in it.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is doubtleſs meant by another Metaphor which the ſame Apoſtle had uſed, Verſe 21. Where he calls the word which is able to ſave the ſoul, an <hi>ingrafted word.</hi> For if the word be able to ſave the ſoul but as it is an ingrafted word, then it becomes an effectual means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as it is faſtened upon and let into the ſoul by ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56474:86"/>on. For conſideration anſwers the Metaphor of ingrafting here uſed. If the juice of a Cyon the Branch of a good Tree, turn the Sap of a Crab Tree Stock into it's own nature, and cauſe it to bring forth better fruit than before, it is by means of being let into it and bound faſt upon it, that it does ſo. In like manner if the word turn the temper of the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own nature by mingling with it, it is by means of conſideration, which unites the word and the mind, and binds it upon the ſoul. For the word does not work after the manner of a Charm or Spell, but ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in a way of rational conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For this is the way of the Spirits working by the word. When men with <hi>open Face behold</hi> as in a Glaſs the glory of the Lord, they are changed into the ſame image as it were by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. The Holy Spirit works this change indeed, but it is by the Goſpel, and by the Goſpel looked into, beheld and well conſidered.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56474:86"/>
               <p>This conſidering temper of mind, ſeems to be ſignified by the good ground in the Parable, by which thoſe are reſembled, who when they have heard the word, <hi>keep it,</hi> to wit, in their minds and under conſideration; in oppoſition to thoſe other hearers of the Goſpel, who for <hi>a total want</hi> of conſideration, immediately loſe all they hear, as thoſe do who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by the high-way on which ſome ſeed fell, where it had no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering at all: And in oppoſition to thoſe who for want of <hi>much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> wither when perſecution comes, like thoſe reſembled by the rocky ground on which ſome of the ſeed was ſown, where there was not <hi>much earth</hi> to give it ſufficient root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and nouriſhment: And alſo in oppoſition to thoſe who through an <hi>inſufficient degree of conſideration,</hi> have the word driven out of their minds, or weakened in its operation, by the over-powering thoughts, cares, and pleaſures of this preſent life, as thoſe reſembled by the thorny ground
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56474:87"/>have; and ſo bring forth no fruit to <hi>perfection,</hi> but only the ear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the full corn in the ear, Luke 8.</p>
               <p>In this thing, then which we call Conſideration, ſeems to lie the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe who hear the Goſpel ſo as effectually to believe it, and thoſe other ſeveral ſorts of hearers, who though they hear it, yet do not believe it to the ſaving of their ſouls. For which cauſe it may well be that the Author to the Hebrews, preſſeth the Chriſtians who were in danger of withering like the Corn which had not much earth, through heat of perſecution, to <hi>give the more earneſt heed</hi> to the things which they had heard, leſt at any time they ſhould let them <hi>ſlip, viz.</hi> out of their minds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>David,</hi> no doubt, well knew of how great concernment it is to have good things kept warm upon the mind by often repeated conſideration, when he prayed thus unto God: <hi>Keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56474:87"/>of the hearts of thy people, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their heart unto thee.</hi> 1 Chro. 29.18.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen now in part what men (by advantage of the Goſpel which is the preventive Grace of God, antecedent to all endeavours of ours) can do towards their own believing: And likewiſe what that ſubſequent Grace is by which we are enabled to believe throughly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually unto Righteouſneſs and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. There is yet one thing more to be taken into conſideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can ſo well be reſolved as then we may, in what capacity men are of performing the condition of the promiſe of pardon and Life: And therefore I ſhall add that one thing more, which is this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We have aſſurance given us of having the ſubſequent Grace of God conferred upon us to enable us to believe unto Righteouſneſs, if we do not groſly neglect to do what we can do towards our believing, in uſing and improving the antecedent
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56474:88"/>Grace of God. See this clearly proved by that of our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24, 25. Where he ſpeaks to his followers and hearers thus. <hi>Take heed what you hear: with what ineaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured unto you: and unto you that hear ſhall more be given. For he that hath, to him ſhall be given: and he that hath not, from him ſhall be taken even that which he hath.</hi> By which our Saviour ſeems to mean, that men ſhall receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the Goſpel, according as they attend to and conſider their own great concerns handled in it: And that if by thus doing they do not neglect but uſe and improve this antecedent Grace, that then more ſhall be given; to wit, more means and more help to believe; which is the ſubſequent Grace I have been ſpeaking of, by which men are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly enabled to believe unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo unto Pardon and Life.</p>
               <p>Theſe words of our Saviour, which according to our tranſlation we read,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56474:88"/>
                  <hi>Take heed what you hear,</hi> are rendred by Dr. <hi>Hammond, Conſider</hi> what you hear. So that it ſeems, Take heed what you hear, does in this place ſignifie, Take heed to what you hear, or to give heed to it as thoſe do who conſider of it and weigh the import of it, as whether they are concerned in it, and if yea, then how far. And the reaſon which our Saviour adds to inforce this Precept and direction of his, ſhews this to be the ſenſe of it. For he ſays, With what meaſure we mete, it ſhall be meaſured to us, to wit, in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and benefit deſigned us by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to us, which is to bring us to believe unto Righteouſneſs, that ſo we may be ſaved. And he adds again, that to thoſe that hear, <hi>viz.</hi> that thus hear, more ſhall be given, and backs this alſo with that general rule mentioned five times in three of the Evangeliſts: for he that hath, to him ſhall be given, and he that hath not, from him ſhall be taken even that which he hath. Now what can
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56474:89"/>the meaſure be which is meted in hearing the Goſpel, to which the promiſe of receiving more is made? but an attentive conſideration who it is that ſpeaks, what he ſpeaks, and of what concernment it is. And what can that meaſure be which is meted in hearing, which is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a remanding of what had been depoſited in their hands, but a not minding, regarding, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the weight of what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor how they are concerned in it?</p>
               <p>If this then be the meaning of our Saviour, as I doubt not but it is; then we ſee the promiſe of Divine aſſiſtance is made to ſuch endeavours of ours, as we are capable of uſing, through that providence of God by which mans faculties are ſuſtained and aſſiſted to operate according to what is proper to the nature of them. So that if any man who enjoys the Goſpel, periſh, it is through his own neglect to do what he was able to have done towards his own belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56474:89"/>It is indeed for his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but then the reaſon of his not believing and the fault of it, is imputable only unto him and lies wholly at his door. Becauſe he might have believed and would certainly have been enabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if he had not groſly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to do what he could and might have done towards it.</p>
               <p>If this were not ſo, that men might as certainly believe, repent and make themſelves new hearts (if they can but be perſuaded to do what they can do towards it) as if they had all the power requiſite thereto in their own hands; then to what purpoſe are they required by God in Scripture as they are, to <hi>believe,</hi> to <hi>make themſelves new hearts,</hi> and to <hi>repent and turn themſelves from all their tranſgreſſions, to circumciſe their hearts, to waſh their hearts from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to cleanſe themſelves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of fleſh and Spirit?</hi> or why and in what reſpect elſe can men be ſaid <hi>to ſave themſelves?</hi> Which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56474:90"/>yet they are, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31, 32. and 14.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. It is from the certainty of Gods cooperating with mens endeavours to the producing of theſe effects, if men fail not to do what they well may do, that theſe effects are aſcribed to men as well as unto God; though God be indeed the principal Agent beyond all compariſon, and men but in a very inferior degree the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate. Though ſalvation be of the Lord, and that beſides him there is no Saviour, in a ſenſe proper to him, yet in a ſenſe proper to mens endeavours, St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſdained not to aſſure <hi>Timothy,</hi> that if he <hi>took heed to himſelf</hi> and to his doctrine, and continued therein, that then in ſo doing he ſhould both <hi>ſave himſelf</hi> and thoſe that heard him. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>It is a common thing in Scripture where ſeveral free Agents concur to the producing of the ſame effect, to attribute the effect to both, though
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56474:90"/>the Agency of the one of them be never ſo inferiour to the other. Thus though God is ſaid to give a new heart and a new ſpirit, and to circumciſe the heart (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.) yet men are ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in ſome capacity to make themſelves new hearts, and to circumciſe their own hearts, in as much as they are required to do it, as I have ſhewed: That is, they are ſuppoſed to be in a capacity to do ſomthing towards it, though very little in compariſon of what is done by God therein, when it is done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Thus again men are required to work out their own ſalvation, when yet it is God that worketh in them both to will and to do of his good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. Which is not ſo to be underſtood as if God did work in them to will and to do excluſive of all endeavours of theirs: for if that had been his meaning, he would thereby have rendred his own exhortation and the reaſon of it uſeleſs, in perſuading
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56474:91"/>them to work out their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that reaſon, becauſe it is God which worketh in them both to will and to do of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nor yet is it ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood on the other hand as if men could do all of themſelves which is neceſſary for the working out or carrying the buſineſs of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quite through, without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſiſtance. But his meaning then ſeems to be, that it is the good will and pleaſure of God to work in ſuch men both to will and to do to the ſaving of their ſouls, who do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour through the preventive and concomitant Grace of God, to do what they can do towards it. When the work of Grace in man is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God and Chriſt, it is not to be underſtood excluſively of all endeavours of men. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaking of his Diſciples bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruit, ſaith, <hi>without me ye can do nothing;</hi> he does not ſay nor mean, that with him they could do nothing. When it was ſaid to the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56474:91"/>
                  <hi>Iſraelites, Deut.</hi> 8. it is God that <hi>giveth you power to get wealth,</hi> their own endeavours in that acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were not excluded, but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, I ſuppoſe, that the means, the opportunities and advantages on that behalf, were of God, and the ordering of his good providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Though <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays in one place, The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, yet he ſaith in another, The diligent hand maketh rich. Though it be but very little which man doth towards his believing in compariſon of what God doth, yet the effect of that doing, the act of believing, is ſtill from place to place aſcribed unto men; for it is they are aſcribed unto men; for it is they that are ſaid to believe. How much ſoever God doth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Faith in men, yet therein ſtill mans faculties are preſerved in ſuch a free uſe and exerciſe, as is proper to ſuch a creature as God hath made man to be, and from thence it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated his act, as I have ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56474:92"/>
               <p>Now then if this were not ſo, that God hath by advantage of the Goſpel where it comes, given ſo much power unto men of acting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own believing, and ſo much aſſurance of his further aſſiſtance to enable them to believe unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if they groſly neglect <hi>not to do</hi> what they can do towards it: I ſay if this were not ſo, how can it poſſibly ſtand with the infinite goodneſs of the nature of God, for him to damn men for not believing, or with the ſincerity of ſuch ſayings of his in which he hath declared, That he is not willing that any man ſhould periſh, and that he would have all men to be ſaved, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.) How will God be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this in the ſight of Angels and men, and in the conſciences of condemned ſinners themſelves, if their unbelief and periſhing for it, were not through their own neglect? And how elſe could mens deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be ſaid, as it is, to be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56474:92"/>
               <p>We ſee then from the nature of the thing and the honor of God, as concerned in it, as well as from the evidence of Scripture, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have to hold that all men under the Goſpel, are in ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of performing the condition of the promiſe of Pardon and Life by believing, as that if they do it not, it is through their own groſs and wilful neglect to do what they might have done towards it. And for any to make God ſo the Author of mens deſtruction, as to affirm that he never put them into a capacity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it by believing, is a daring undertaking, whoever ventures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and tends to tempt men to think diſhonorably of the goodneſs of God, and of the truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his declarations in his word.</p>
               <p>To ſay, God did give ſuch men power in <hi>Adam,</hi> will not ſalve the buſineſs. For we cannot ſay that any ſuch power was given to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf before his fall, much leſs that all his Poſterity had ſuch a power
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56474:93"/>in him. We cannot ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> had power to do more than what was neceſſary to continue him in that ſtate in which God created him, and conſequently we cannot ſay that God gave him power to repent when he had no occaſion for it, or power to believe the Goſpel, when there was no Revelation of it, nor occaſion for ſuch a Revelation. No, this power depends upon an after-work of Grace through our Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Nor is this doctrine touching the power which God hath given unto men of acting towards their own believing, at all contrary to that where men are ſaid to have <hi>believed through grace,</hi> Acts 18.27. or to that where Faith is ſaid to be <hi>the gift of God.</hi> For it is through the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and antecedent Grace of God, as I have ſaid, that they are enabled to act towards their believing. For though what they do towards their own believing, is by a free uſe of their natural faculties, yet it is by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56474:93"/>means of the preventive and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Grace of God, to wit, the Goſpel, that thoſe faculties act any thing towards their believing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. For without ſuch an object of Faith as the Goſpel is, mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties could act nothing towards the believing of it. And then further, though men do exerciſe their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties upon the objective Grace of God, and thereby act ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards their own believing; Yet in that hereupon more power is given them to believe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>lie, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually and fully to Righteouſneſs and Salvation, this power is from the ſubſequent Grace of God. So that the whole buſineſs of believing from the beginning to the end of it, is of Grace; firſt of Grace antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and then of Grace ſubſequent.</p>
               <p>There is only ſo much of man in raiſing Faith in him, as belongs to the free uſe of his natural powers and faculties. The Grace of God in working Faith, does not put new faculties into man, nor deſtroy that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56474:94"/>freedom which is proper to the will as ſuch: It only rectifies and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the motions and operations of the will in reference to its objects. So that the change is not natural, but moral. And this moral change in rectifying and regulating the acts and motions of the will, is made partly by opening the underſtanding and enlightening the mind better to diſcern the nature of things, and whereto they tend. And this is done partly by holding the thoughts more frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y and more intently upon things that concern the ſoul and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life: and partly by aſſiſting and ſtrengthening the underſtanding in making a right judgment of things. And then the will is prevailed upon to chuſe the right end, and the way to it, by having the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Goſpel kept upon it, by a more frequent and conſtant conſideration. For by that more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſideration, and by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the mind about the great motives of the Goſpel, the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56474:94"/>power and force of thoſe motives is better felt by the Will. So that as a man comes to have other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things by illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, ſo he comes to have other affections for them in the acts and motions of his will. This change thus made in the mnid and will, is called the <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe it is his work upon and by both, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and a being <hi>renewed in the ſpirit of the mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. It is a reſtoring the natural faculties that were depraved in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to their right uſe and exerciſe for which they were made, which was to act for the honor of their maker and for their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not contrarywiſe as they do, when perverted by the power of ſin. This renovation in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties therefore tends to the perfecting of our nature. For which cauſe perhaps men thus renewed, are in Scripture ſtiled <hi>perfect</hi> in the favourable ſenſe of Grace. This one thing is further to be noted, That
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56474:95"/>whatever is done upon the natural faculties of mind and will by the Goſpel, or by the Spirit of God, to change and renew them, is alſo done by thoſe faculties. Men are not made to underſtand or believe the Goſpel which they did not before, otherwiſe than by exerciſing their mind and will about it.</p>
               <p>By all this then it appears, I hope, that what is aſcribed unto man in acting towards his own believing, is no ways contrary to Grace, unleſs you will ſay an effect cannot be of Grace, if the natural faculties have any thing to do in the producing of it, as they muſt, if it be mans act.</p>
               <p>I might ſhew how that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by the giving of which God hath been aforehand with us and prevented all endeavours of ours, is of it ſelf and in the very nature of it, ſo apt to work upon the human faculties, and to incline men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, if they would but a little attend to it and conſider it, (which one would think they might eaſily
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56474:95"/>do, if they would, before their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are debauched by a cuſtom of ſinning) I ſay, it is ſo apt to gain upon them, that it hardly fails to do ſo more or leſs, but where it meets with ſuch as wilfully call off their natural faculties from attending to it and the things it treats of, and that imploy them about objects of another nature, as thoſe did who in the Parable of our Saviour are ſaid to be invited to the Supper which a King made for his Son, when they made their ſeveral excuſes. This is well repreſented by our Saviour when he ſays of ſuch, that they <hi>cloſed their eyes,</hi> leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted and I ſhould heal them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. Theſe are words which ſeem to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie more than a bare omiſſion or neglect, and denote a kind of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſtriving with themſelves not to think upon or to be affected with things of that nature, as thoſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56474:96"/>of a ſpiritual concern are. And ſuch people do not only not <hi>incline</hi> their ears to hear, nor <hi>give ear</hi> to hear, as the Scripture ſpeaks, but they <hi>turn away their ear</hi> from hearing: they <hi>reject the word of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the counſel of God againſt themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not therefore attribute any ſuch great matter unto men, when we ſay that they by the advantage of the Goſpel, may do ſo much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own believing, if they will, as would through the help of Gods Holy Spirit (who is always ready to aſſiſt mens honeſt and good endeavours) iſſue and end in an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual believing. Nay, there is ſo much of the Grace of God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed towards the calling of men by the very ſending of the Goſpel to them, as will in all probability prevail upon them, if they do not much oppoſe, reſiſt and ſtrive againſt its prevailing upon them, as I have ſhewed: For the Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now then if this be true, that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56474:96"/>God by means of his antecedent Grace, hath given ſuch power unto men, of acting towards their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Righteouſneſs, as hath been ſaid there is; then there is very great reaſon this ſhould be made known to them, and that they ſhould not be made believe that they have no more power of acting towards their own Salvation, than there is in a dead man to raiſe himſelf to life. I ſay there is great reaſon for this, becauſe their Salvation or Damnation are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. For to perſuade men that they have no power to act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their believing, is the direct way to take them off from the uſe of means tending thereto. For what greater diſcouragement can be given unto men to attempt a thing, than to perſuade them that they have no power of accompliſhing it if they do. <hi>As good never a whit as never the better,</hi> as the Proverb runs.</p>
               <p>The quite contrary is doubtleſs to be done by ſuch as would not betray mens ſouls to deſtruction, nor
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56474:97"/>lay a ſtumbling block in their way, nor cramp their endeavours in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſaved. They ſhould be throughly acquainted with what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er God hath put into their hands of being ſaved if they will, by having given them his Goſpel and power to hear and conſider the terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that are therein offered to them, and the powerful motives that tend to perſuade them to believe and obey it. They ſhould be brought to a great ſenſe that God is not nor will be wanting to them in his Grace and aſſiſtance, nor in the matter of their ſalvation, if they be not greatly wanting to themſelves in not doing what they may and can do towards it. That God hath ſet life and death before them and perſuaded them to chuſe life, and that he hath given them power to do ſo much towards it, by the helps wherewith he hath prevented them, as that he will not fail to give them ſo much more as ſhall put them into an immediate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ſalvation, if they will but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56474:97"/>make ſuch uſe as they may and can, of that which he hath already given them: And that therefore if they periſh, it is of their own choice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they judg themſelves unworthy of everlaſting life. And that for this cauſe they will be left without all excuſe if they periſh, and that God will be juſtified in their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that he hath done that which was ſufficient on his part to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it.</p>
               <p>It was not the manner of our Saviour to perſuade men that they could do nothing towards their own ſalvation, but complains of them ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ye will not</hi> come to me that ye might have life: how oft would I have gathered you as a Hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her Chickens under her wings, and <hi>ye would not;</hi> and expoſtulates the matter with them, ſaying, <hi>yea and why even of your ſelves judg ye not what is right:</hi> And from time to time cryed to them in his doctrin with an extended voice, ſaying, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath ears to hear let them hear:</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:56474:98"/>meaning, that if they would make uſe of their teachable and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative faculties in any thing, then about thoſe things he preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And upbraided thoſe that would not, when they had eyes to ſee, and ears to hear, other things wherein they were nothing ſo much concerned as they were in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſaying, <hi>they ſeeing, ſee not, and hearing, hear not, neither do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi> And can any man that thinks well of our Saviour, wiſely think alſo that he upbraided them for not doing that which they had no power to do.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs although it be Gods <hi>ordinary</hi> declared method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with men in reference to their ſalvation, to add a ſubſequent power to enable ſuch to believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Righteouſneſs, who had not groſly neglected to uſe and improve the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent power and Grace which had been vouchſafed them before: yet doubtleſs God always reſerves unto himſelf a liberty of acting <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:56474:98"/>in a way of Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, where and when and to what degree he pleaſeth, though they have not improved, but groſly neglected their firſt talents. Several inſtances of this nature there have been in men whoſe natures and lives have been debauched with a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ſinning, who yet have been ſurpriſed as it were on a ſuddain, and their conſciences awakened and let looſe upon them, either by a Sermon, or ſome great affliction, or ſome other providence, and ſuch a change preſently wrought, that they have afterward become very good men. And ſo God hath been found of thoſe that ſought him not, as the Prophet ſpeaks; as he was by the extraordinary Converſion of thoſe of the Gentile Nations upon the firſt going out of the Goſpel among them, many of whom till then had lived without God in the world, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Now this liberty of ſhewing more Grace and favour to ſome than to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56474:99"/>othres, God may well make uſe of, and yet no man have cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that he does ſo, ſo long as he is not wanting to the reſt in that which is ſufficient unto their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but puts it within their own power to be ſaved, if they will. So that if they periſh, it is through their own wilful neglect to do what they might have done. Indeed God can no more wrong one creature than another, becauſe he cannot but do right to all: But in diſpenſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, it is nowiſe unbecoming his wiſdom and goodneſs, to do more for one creature than for anotheer; no more than it was in the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he did not make all Men Angels, nor all Brutes Men. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thy eye evil becauſe I am good?</hi> ſaith the Houſholder in the Parable, to him that murmured for that he that laboured but one hour in the Vineyard, had as much as the hire of another for a whole day came to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56474:99"/>
               <p>Since then it is but Gods unuſual and extraordinary way to convert ſome ſuch men by ſurpriſing them with the mighty operations of his Grace, as had in a manner wholly neglected the improvement of their firſt Talents, the antecedent Grace of God: And ſince he hath made no promiſe of doing ſo for any man, but rather on the contrary threatened to take away from ſuch that which they had received before; It remains then that no man preſume or take any encouragement to neglect Gods ordinary and preſcribed way and means of attaining to Grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in hope that God ſhould go out of his uſual way to meet with them and to convert them in a way and manner that is unuſual and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. No man in his wits will act by ſuch meaſures in things pertaining to this preſent life and the outward man. Some men we now and then ſee have ſtrange and fortunate hits in the world, Eſtates conferred on them unexpectedly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56474:100"/>any labour or induſtry of theirs. But will any man in hopes it may ſo fall out with him, neglect to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his calling for a lively-hood? To be ſure no man worthy the name of a man will. What folly then is to be compared with that which ſuch men commit, that deſpiſe their own ſouls in taking leſs care for them, though of eternal durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than for this ſhort and tranſitory life?</p>
               <p>But yet although God hath not promiſed that any ſhall <hi>have,</hi> but thoſe that <hi>ask,</hi> nor <hi>find</hi> except they <hi>ſeek,</hi> nor have it <hi>opened</hi> to them, unleſs they <hi>knock;</hi> to the end that none might promiſe themſelves an obtaining without ſo doing: And although God vouchſafeth unto men the Goſpel as a means ſufficient of it ſelf to perſuade them to conſider their eternal concerns, and to look after them more than any thing that concerns only this preſent life, and to learn them without all excuſe if they do not: Yet when I conſider
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56474:100"/>the exceeding riches of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and how full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion he is, and how unwilling he is that any ſhould periſh; I cannot, I confeſs, but think that he does more to prevent the deſtruction even of thoſe that do periſh, than what is abſolutely neceſſary and barely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent it, if men did not through their own obſtinacy and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs receive ſuch Grace of God in vain. I cannot but think that God does more to bring men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, both thoſe that do and thoſe that do not actually and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repent, than what he ever promiſed or engaged himſelf to do, by his ſpirits ſtriving with them by many inward and ſecret motions and operations upon their minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, until by long and obſtinate reſiſtance, the good ſpirit is cauſed to withdraw his applications; by which withdrawing that which they before had, is taken from them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is threatned to ſuch as will not improve their Talent,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56474:101"/>and they delivered up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind to be hardened. Why ſhould we not think but that God is as ready by his Holy Spirit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and ſtir up men to that which tends to their happineſs, as evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are to tempt them to that which tends to their deſtruction? When all the methods whereby God ſeeketh to bring men to repentance are thwarted and withſtood, the Holy Ghoſt is in Scripture then ſaid to be reſiſted: Which ſhews, that the Holy Ghoſt is much concerned in thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but that when the Scripture ſaith that God would have all men to be ſaved, we may ſafely conclude, that he uſeth all means both internal and external to effect it, ſo far as is agreeable to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and unerring wiſdom, when all circumſtances in the caſe are weighed and conſidered; and that it is really better and will appear ſo one day, that ſuch men ſhould periſh which do periſh, rather than any more
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56474:101"/>ſhould be done by God to prevent it, than he hath done before deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction befal them. And it is better, not becauſe God takes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the damnation than in the ſalvation of ſuch as periſh, ſimply and in it ſelf conſidered: For he himſelf hath told us, and ſworn it, leſt we ſhould not firmly believe it, That <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live,</hi> Ezek. 33.11. But it is better in reference to the publick good of his Creation in general, the peace and good order whereof is thereby ſecured, which otherwiſe was and ſtill would be diſquieted and put into confuſion by them, as it is now by the Devils, while they are not ſhut up in Priſon, as hereafter they will be. This reaſon of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as have neglected their own Salvation, as it refers to this publick good, is implyed in thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41. Where he ſays, <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56474:102"/>gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend,</hi> and in thoſe likewiſe, Ver. 49. where he ſays, <hi>ſo ſhall it be at the end of the world: the Angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt.</hi> And another reaſon among others of ſuch mens puniſhment referring to the publick good, is, That virtue and goodneſs on the one hand, and wickedneſs and vice on the other, might the better appear to be what they are in their own nature, by their ſenſible effects, and ſo be loved or hated according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which we cannot conceive they would ever be ſo effectually as now they are and will be, if they were not attended with rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the wiſe ordering of the Author and Governor of all beings. It was by the ſenſible effects of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the forbidden Tree, that <hi>Adam</hi> had that knowledg of evil as differing from good, which he had not before. Now ſuch knowledg of the the difference between good and evil by rewards and puniſhments, is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56474:102"/>of great uſe in the univerſal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Government of God. And if it were not better in reference to the general good, that men ſhould periſh for their wilful neglect and refuſal to make uſe of ſuch means to prevent their deſtruction, as God hath vouchſafed them, and by the uſe whereof they might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it if they would, we could not well conceive how there ſhould be any ſuch thing as the deſtruction of wicked men, other than what lies in the very nature of their ſin it ſelf, (it putting the courſe of nature into diſorder, confuſion and torture) ſo long as God takes no pleaſure in their deſtruction for their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake.</p>
               <p>So much may ſuffice to ſhew in what capacity men are of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition on which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin and eternal life are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; which performance is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity to their juſtification. And if in doing this I have ſaid more than was barely
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56474:103"/>neceſſary to this end, yet perhaps not more than was neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent mens miſunderſtanding miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and miſimprovement of what was neceſſarily ſaid on that head of diſcourſe; conſidering how apt ſome of weak minds are, to ſuſpect, if not to cry out <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> where any ability in men to work out their own ſalvation, is mentioned, though there be not the leaſt ground for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt thing I propoſed to inquire into concerning Faith, is how we may conceive that Faith does more immediately <hi>operate to our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi> And what hath been ſaid already touching Faith in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars, may with a little reflection upon them, ſatisfie us in this enquiry. For ſuch a Faith as I have deſcribed, a Faith that is a vital and vigorous principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and of a holy life, does <hi>Operate</hi> to our Juſtification as it is our <hi>Covenant-Righteouſneſs,</hi> as it is the performance of the condition on
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56474:103"/>which pardon of ſin and eternal Life are promiſed. For as it is ſuch and as it comprehends in it its proper effects, it doth <hi>conſtitute</hi> thoſe in whomſoever it is found, <hi>Righteous</hi> perſons according to the tenor of the Goſpel-Covenant, and ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them to be ſo adjudged by God againſt all accuſations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by what or by whomſoever. It is that which makes their cauſe good when they come to be tried and judged by the Law of Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is all which that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to denominate them Righteous, and to entitle them to the benefit of that Law. This Righteouſneſs of Faith is the eſſential matter or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cauſe of our Juſtification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no ſuch thing could be, and ſuppoſing which, it cannot but be, ſo long as the Goſpel-Covenant ſtands in force. It makes thoſe that have it, the proper <hi>ſubjects</hi> of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: for as God will condemn the wicked, ſo he will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Juſtifie the Righteous, ſuch as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56474:104"/>are made ſo by his own Grace: without reſpect of perſons he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth acocrding to every mans work and the nature of his cauſe. In theſe and the like reſpects doth the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith operate to our Juſtification. Theſe things ſtand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in what hath been ſaid before in opening the nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and the nature of Faith and the reaſon of its deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by God to its Office and work. And may be yet further confirmed by thoſe Scriptures where Faith is ſaid to be <hi>counted and imputed to us for Righteouſneſs,</hi> as it was to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Rom. 4.3, 6, 11, 22, 24. Gal. 3.6. Gen. 15.6. Jam. 2.23. For if God count it to us for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then it is our Righteouſneſs: for God accounts of things but as they are when they are what they are of his own making, as this Righteouſneſs of Faith is. And if this Faith be our Righteouſneſs in Gods account, then they muſt needs be Righteous in his account that are
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56474:104"/>Righteous with this Righteouſneſs, and be approved of and adjudged ſuch by him. And thus Faith ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to our Juſtification as it is the eſſential and intrinſical matter of our Juſtification.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>How God himſelf operates to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Come now in the laſt place to enquire in what reſpects Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is attributed to God, and what his operation is in producing this great effect of Juſtifying ſuch as have been ſinners. That he doth Juſtifie believers by ſome acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him, is no Chriſtians doubt. <hi>It is one God which ſhall Juſtifie the Circumciſion by Faith, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion through Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.30. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? <hi>it is God that juſtifieth,</hi> Rom. 8.33.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:56474:105"/>
               <p>Now God may be ſaid to Juſtifie in ſeveral reſpects, ſome more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and ſome more proximate and immediate. God is the Author, Spring and Fountain, and principal efficient cauſe of all other cauſes that any way concur or cooperate to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Chriſt himſelf which is the foundation ſtone in this building, by virtue of whoſe Mediatorial Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs we are Juſtified, <hi>he is made to us of God, Wiſdom and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. It is alſo God which hath given being to the new Covenant which is the Covenant of his Grace, by virtue of which alſo we are Juſtified. And the Righteouſneſs of Faith which is the matter of our Juſtification, is of Gods working in us by his Spirit. Whence it is that both our Sanctification and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>But ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which we have now principally to conſider, is, what that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56474:105"/>laſt act is or thoſe laſt acts are by which God Juſtifies us. And his operation herein is judicial; for he Juſtifies as a Judg, and therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by his own Law of Grace, as the rule of judging of men and their cauſe. And Gods judicial Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, doth ſtand I conceive in theſe two things principally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God in juſtifying of men <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> of them for ſuch as have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition, on which he in the Covenant of Grace promiſed pardon of ſin and eternal Life: That is, he approves of them for true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and ſuch as have given up themſelves to obey the Goſpel, to live according to the doctrine of their Saviour, and adjudgeth them to be ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe whom God approveth of as true and ſincere obſervers of the new Law, the Goſpel or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, thoſe he adjudgeth to be Righteous perſons, and that Faith of theirs by which they have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it, to be their Righteouſneſs.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56474:106"/>True believers and ſuch as have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up themſelves to obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, they are Juſtified by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; that is, they are Righteous in the ſenſe and meaning of that Law. For that practical obediential Faith of theirs, is their conformity to this Law of Chriſt the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be their Evangelical Righteouſneſs. But there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between being juſtified by the Goſpel, as it is the new Law of Grace, and by being juſtified by God: The Goſpel-Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth all true believers in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> to be Righteous perſons, but doth not determine whether this or that perſon in particular be a true believer, and ſo a Righteous man or woman. But God in juſtifying men determineth and adjudgeth this and that man in ſpecial to be a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and therefore a Righteous man in the ſence of the Law of Grace. It is the work of a Judg to apply the Law as a general rule, to the ſpecial caſes of particular men, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56474:106"/>to juſtifie or condemn men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in reference to their particular caſes, by and according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule of the Law. And ſo doth God the Judg of all, in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. He knows and conſiders every man in particular, whether he be a true believer or not: And thoſe whom he finds to be ſo, thoſe he adjudgeth to be Righteous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is his juſtifying of them.</p>
               <p>Now that God juſtifieth men this way and after this manner, does I conceive plainly and fully appear by thoſe Scriptures which tell us, that God doth juſtifie us by Faith, and that he doth impute or account Faith to us for Righteouſneſs. One vein of Scriptures acquaints us that God juſtifieth us by Faith and through Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28, 30. and 5.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. and 3.8. By another vein of Texts we are told, that God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, accounts and reckons Faith to us for Righteouſneſs. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3, 5, 11, 22, 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56474:107"/>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. Now theſe two veins of Scripture put together, the ſenſe that reſults out of them is I think plainly this, <hi>That God juſtifies us by accounting our Faith to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> This is ſo plain, as that I know not what can well be plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In the one vein it's ſaid that God juſtifieth us by Faith: in the other that he imputes and reckons Faith to us for Righteouſneſs. And for God to account Faith to us for Righteouſneſs, and to reckon and adjudg us to be Righteous upon the account of our Faith, ſignifies I think, the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>That God juſtifies men by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and adjudging them to be Righteous by being true believers, and therein conformable to the terms of the Goſpel, on which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it are made, will further appear, if we conſider Juſtification in a notion oppoſite to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In condemnation or when men are condemned by God, they are convicted of a double guilt.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56474:107"/>Firſt, of a guiltineſs of fault; that they are guilty of ſuch tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law by which they are tryed, as is damnable in the ſenſe of that Law. Secondly, of the guilt of penalty, upon which they are adjuged and ſentenced to ſuffer that penalty: The guilt of fault of which they are convicted and for which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſuffer the penalty, is <hi>final infidelity, impenitence and wilful diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now God in juſtifying men, does as Judg vindicate and defend them againſt all accuſations, from being guilty of ſuch unbelief, impenitency and diſobedience; which vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defence, is the ſame thing with his adjudging them to be true believers, penitent, and ſuch as have delivered up themſelves ſincerely to obey the Laws of their Saviour, which is his juſtifying of them.</p>
               <p>And now having thus endeavoured to open and explain the doctrine, the nature and notion of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its ſeveral cauſes; I ſhall now
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56474:108"/>recapitulate or rehearſe in a few words, the ſum and ſubſtance of what hath been more largely diſcourſed about it; to the end the whole of it may come under our view at once.</p>
               <p>The obedience of Chriſt to the Law of Mediation in dying for us does operate to our Juſtification, by obtaining terms of Gods being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us: and his obedience to the ſame Law in publiſhing the Goſpel, does operate to the ſame end, by perſuading us by it to be reconciled to God in obſerving thoſe terms, upon the obſervation of which, we become juſtified by God as well as reconciled to him, and juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe reconciled.</p>
               <p>The new Covenant operates to our Juſtification, by virtue of the death of Chriſt by which it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as it is a new Law of Grace, ſtating, ſetling, and ſetting forth the benefits therein promiſed; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin and eternal Life, and alſo the terms on which theſe benefits are
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56474:108"/>to be conferred and received, to wit, a vigorous and operative Faith: and this Covenant further operates to our Juſtification, as by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the foreſaid benefits, it is Gods great inſtrument to perſuade men to obſerve and perform thoſe terms or that condition in believing, on which they are promiſed, which performance is that which qualifies us for the bleſſing of being Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Faith operates to our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it is the performance of the condition on which the promiſe of the Pardon of ſin and eternal Life is made through Chriſt: and as that Faith is the new Covenant-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo the matter of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Almighty God himſelf operates to our Juſtification, as he reckons, imputes, and counts this Faith to us for Righteouſneſs, and as he does approve each one that hath this Faith as a Righteous perſon accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tenor of his own Law of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56474:109"/>Grace, and as he doth adjudg him to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Having as I conceive now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently proved that Gods judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Juſtifying of us, ſtands in his adjudging us to have performed the condition on which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Pardon of ſin and eternal Life, in that we have believed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and delivered up ourſelves to the conduct of it; and likewiſe in accounting this Faith to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and in approving of us as Righteous hereupon: I ſhall now proceed to ſhew ſomewhat of the difference that is between Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Remiſſion of Sins, at leaſt as I apprehend it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the difference between Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſin.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is doubtleſs ſuch a thing as a real difference between Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Remiſſion of ſin. For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that Chriſt is made to us of God <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. he certainly means ſomthing elſe by <hi>Redemption</hi> than he doth by <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> That by <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in this place he means <hi>Juſtification,</hi> I think none will deny. By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption doubtleſs he means a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance firſt and laſt from all the evils and miſeries we ſuffer or have deſerved by reaſon of ſin: deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and <hi>exemption</hi> from which, is <hi>properly pardon</hi> in act. And indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place explains Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Pardon, when he ſays, <hi>in whom we have Redemption through
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56474:110"/>his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Col. 1.14. We ſee then that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did reckon Juſtification and Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins to be two diſtinct things, benefits of a different nature. I ſhall now name to you ſome of thoſe things wherein they differ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Juſtification is Gods <hi>adjudging</hi> us to have performed the condition in believing, on which he hath made promiſe of Pardon. But Pardon it ſelf is his <hi>conferring</hi> that benefit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us which he conditionally had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. By the one God approves of us as having done our part and duty in <hi>keeping Covenant with him:</hi> By the other he <hi>keeps Covenant with us</hi> in performing what he promiſed. And therefore Juſtification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin ſeem to differ as much as Gods adjudging us to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition on which he promiſed Pardon, differs from actual Pardon it ſelf; and as much as his adjudging us to have kept Covenant with him, differs from his keeping Covenant with us.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:56474:110"/>
               <p n="2">2. By Juſtification we are <hi>acquitted</hi> and abſolved from being guilty of <hi>infidelity, impenitency and inſincerity of obedience:</hi> But we are <hi>not thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted</hi> and abſolved from being guilty of <hi>all other ſins,</hi> but come to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged</hi> from them by way of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whether they be ſins againſt the Law or againſt the Goſpel, whether wilful and preſumptuous ſins before converſion, yea former infidelity and impenitency, or of human frailty and infirmity after, together with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections of duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards man. A pardon of all theſe is promiſed on condition of that Faith with its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, by which God Juſtifies us and approves of us as Righteous and good men, according to the tenor of the Goſpel or new Covenant. But then Gods pardoning theſe ſins, and his Juſtifying us as not guilty of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent infidelity, impenitency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity of obedience, on which he promiſed Pardon, are things greatly different.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:56474:111"/>
               <p>Some becauſe they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how we can be juſtified by any Righteouſneſs but ſuch as is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate and <hi>adequate to the demands of the Law:</hi> and becauſe there is none to be found in any man but in our Saviour himſelf; therefore they think we cannot be Juſtified any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than by having his perſonal numerical Righteouſneſs transferred to us and ſo made ours, as that we by it may be accounted to have fulfilled the whole Law and anſwered all the demands of it. But ſuch ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we do not come off from the charge that lies againſt us for not anſwering the demands of the Law, by our fulfilling it by another, but by being <hi>Pardoned</hi> by virtue of Chriſts atonement, and by virtue of the new Law of Grace which he hath obtained by his obedience, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition, on which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is procured and promiſed; which performance, God according to his Grace in the Goſpel, counts to us for Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:56474:111"/>
               <p n="3">3. That Righteouſneſs of Faith by which we are Juſtified, <hi>qualifies</hi> us for the <hi>poſitive</hi> happineſs and glory of the next world: but ſo does not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin as ſuch. That opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faith by which God Juſtifies us, <hi>renews</hi> our nature and makes us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently Righteous, without which we cannot ſuppoſe that God would adjudg us Righteous; without which neither can we ſo much as ſee the Kingdom of God or be capable of enjoying the heavenly ſtate. But now this <hi>renovation</hi> in our nature, is not made by Remiſſion of ſin. That makes a change in a mans ſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but the change which is made in our nature by which we are made capable of the heavenly glory, is by that Faith and the Righteouſneſs of it, by which we are Juſtified. And therefore there is a great difference between the Righteouſneſs of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Remiſſion of ſin in this reſpect alſo.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of which difference, I cannot underſtand how it can be truly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56474:112"/>ſaid, That Juſtification by Remiſſion of ſin (as ſome phraſe it) <hi>will ſtand us in as much ſtead before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God, as Juſtification upon a perfect juſtice would do.</hi> For if it could be ſupppoſed (as it cannot upon good ground) that Remiſſion of ſin might be had without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs in our nature, yet we could not thereby be ſo much as capable of being partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, for which they are <hi>made meet</hi> by that change which is made in their nature through Faith, which God in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of us, reckons to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pardon of ſin, as it does not qualifie our nature for the heavenly glory, ſo neither does it at all <hi>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle men to it,</hi> as the Righteouſneſs of Juſtification by Faith does. We that forfeited the firſt right which man had to happineſs, by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from God, can now have no right or title to it but what God of his own Grace through Chriſt is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56474:112"/>pleaſed <hi>to give us,</hi> or by gift or grant to make over to us. And this right which he has given us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends partly upon a <hi>conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of his; and partly upon <hi>Gods adjudging us to have performed that condition</hi> mentioned in that promiſe. Now God in his new Law of Grace, upon account of what our Saviour hath done and ſuffered to obtain it, hath made promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life to us upon condition of our believing and obeying the Goſpel. Which condition being performed by us, our initial right to eternal Life accrues to us from this promiſe of God founded in our Saviours Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory performance. But then our <hi>compleat</hi> right to it accrues to us from a <hi>judicial act of God,</hi> which is his adjudging us to have performed that condition on which eternal Life is promiſed. The one is as a right in Law, the other as a right by act of judgment grounded on Law. Which judicial act of God, is that by which he Juſtifies us, as that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56474:113"/>Judg to whom it belongs to judg, whether the terms of his own Law of Grace be performed or no, before he confers the benefit promiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And whenever he doth adjudg us to have performed thoſe terms; that judgment and determination of his for us, gives us an <hi>immediate</hi> and compleat right and title to the heavenly happineſs.</p>
               <p>But now Remiſſion of ſin or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, was never made the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe of heavenly glory, nor is it mans act but Gods, and ſo not capable of being made a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a thing: And therefore it cannot in virtue of any promiſe, give us that which I call our initial right to the heavenly glory, which right accrues to us by virtue of Gods promiſe, upon our performance of the condition of it. Nor can this Remiſſion give us that immediate and complete Right to the heavenly glory, which flows to us from Gods adjudging us to have performed the condition on which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56474:113"/>it; becauſe this Remiſſion is no condition of Gods promiſe to us, nor act of our performing. Here then is a manifeſt difference between Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin and Juſtification, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the right we have by the one which we have not by the other, to the heavenly glory.</p>
               <p>Some have indeed argued that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin will ſtand us in as much ſtead as to our reſtauration to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as <hi>a perfect legal</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would have done to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued us in it. Becauſe as they reaſon, the puniſhment of loſs is by Pardon taken off, as well as the puniſhment of ſenſe: and that as by Pardon we are delivered from the one, ſo by it we are alſo reſtored to our title to the other, to what we loſt and ſo to a title to eternal Life. The force of which arguing depends upon a ſuppoſition which will not be granted, nor as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ever be proved. And that is, that if <hi>Adam</hi> and ſo his poſterity had continued in their integrity, they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56474:114"/>would thereby have had a right and title to the Celeſtial happineſs and glory of the upper world. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> and that the <hi>firſt man was of the earth earththy,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47, 50. So that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf ſhould he have continued in that perfect ſtate in which he was created, yet would not for all that have been capable of the Celeſtial glory, unleſs he had put off fleſh and blood, or elſe ſhould have had his body transformed from natural into ſpiritual. Which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever affirms that he ſhould, will doubtleſs be wanting in his proofs. It is far more probable that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſts undertaking as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, was to <hi>advance the nature of man to a more glorious perfection</hi> and happineſs than that which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him in pure nature. He was made <hi>a little lower</hi> than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, though he was crowned with glory and honor. Pſal. 8.5. <hi>But they that ſhall be accounted worthy to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56474:114"/>that other world and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead,</hi> are <hi>equal</hi> to the Angels: Which cannot be meant in reſpect of <hi>immortality</hi> only; for <hi>Adam</hi> who was made lower than they, would have been equal to them in that, had he never ſinned. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35, 36. But our bleſſed Saviour <hi>came that we ſhould have life; and that we ſhould have it more abundantly;</hi> a life ſurpaſſing that which was loſt by the fall, <hi>John</hi> 10.10. And he hath taught his Diſciples and followers in hope of this Celeſtial glory, to ſet more light by this world, than perhaps <hi>Adam</hi> would have been obliged to, had he never fallen, and hath given ſeveral other precepts, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps tranſcend the natural Law it ſelf, as to what <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged to by it before his fall, and all to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie them for a higher ſtate.</p>
               <p>I might further ſhew how that our title to the heavenly inheritance ariſeth out of our adoption to it as joint-heirs with Chriſt, and from Gods free and bounteous donation,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56474:115"/>as eternal Life is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and from our performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which it is promiſed: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they may have <hi>right</hi> to the Tree of Life. From all which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin differs and is another thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our <hi>right and title</hi> to Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin it ſelf, depends upon the ſame terms as our right to glory does, and yet that depends upon our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: For God firſt Juſtifies whom he after glorifies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. And if our right to Remiſſion of ſin depends upon the ſame terms as right to glory does, then Remiſſion of ſin can be no more the ſame thing with Juſtification, than glorification is, but depends upon it as an effect upon a cauſe without which none can receive it.</p>
               <p>Our right to Remiſſion of ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our believing, as the condition on which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, as well as our right to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56474:115"/>glory does. <hi>To him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believes in him ſhall receive Remiſſion of ſins, Acts</hi> 10.43. And this <hi>right</hi> to Remiſſion of ſins, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends as much alſo upon Gods <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging</hi> us to have performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which he hath promiſed Pardon, as our right to glory does. For God does no more actually Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don any, then he glorifies them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he firſt adjudgeth them to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition on which he promiſed Pardon, which dijudication of his, is his Juſtifying of them. And therefore Remiſſion of ſin does as really differ from Juſtification as Glorification does, and is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſequent to it, as Glorification is, and therefore cannot be the ſame thing properly and ſtrictly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God does not forgive all a mans ſins at once nor before they are committed and repented of, but multiplies Pardons as his ſervants multiply ſins of infirmity and their
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56474:116"/>repentances and petitions for Pardon. And if ſo, and if God do not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply as many Juſtifications as he does Pardons to the ſame perſon, then here is another difference between Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſin.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Juſtification is Gods <hi>imputing Righteouſneſs</hi> to us or our Faith for Righteouſneſs. But Pardon of ſin is his <hi>non-imputation of ſin</hi> to us. God by not imputing ſin to us, does not reckon us not to have ſinned, nor not to have deſerved eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: but he then does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſin, when he does not inflict the puniſhment deſerved by and due for ſin. But when he imputes Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or Faith for Righteouſneſs to us, he adjudgeth us to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the terms of his new Law of Grace by believing, by which Law that Faith becomes our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Gods adjudging us to have anſwered the terms of his new Law, and his not inflicting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved penalty of the Old; between
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56474:116"/>his awarding us a recompence of our ſincere conformity to the one, and his not exacting of us what we had deſerved to ſuffer for tranſgreſſing the other. And yet ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſin.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe who place Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods pardoning of ſin, they may pleaſe to conſider, that the benefit of Remiſſion of ſin, does not ſignifie the leſs by being called only by its proper name, Pardon or Forgiveneſs, and not Juſtification, if by Juſtification be meant only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, as they hold it is who limit Juſtification only to that. And if Remiſſion of ſin ſignifie no more when we call it Juſtification, then it does when we call it Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or Forgiveneſs. I ſee little reaſon why two or three or ſome ſmall number of Texts of Scripture which ſpeak of Juſtification fomwhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, ſhould be ſo much ſtrained as they are, to make them ſeem to mean only Remiſſion of ſin, when they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56474:117"/>may be fairly underſtood in another ſenſe, and that too perhaps with more congruity to the ſignification of the word Juſtification, and to the nature of the thing, and to the Scriptures themſelves elſewhere. Nor can I diſcern what would be gained by it, if it ſhould be granted that Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin were Juſtification, and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication Remiſſion of ſin. For yet then the ſame thing, the ſame bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit would ſignifie no more when we call it Juſtification, than it does when we call it only Remiſſion of ſins, as we all agree the Scriptures doe.</p>
               <p>Nor does the placing of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Gods Judicial act in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and adjudging men to be Righteous in a Goſpel ſenſe, who have performed the condition on which Pardon of ſin and eternal Life are promiſed, make the priviledg of having our ſins forgiven, the leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to us, or the leſs of Grace from God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For Gods approving us to be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in a Goſpel ſence, does not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56474:117"/>ſuppoſe or imply that we ſtand in no need of Pardon, nor of that mercy of God and merit of Chriſt from which Pardon flows: it only ſuppoſeth us to be Righteous with ſuch a Righteouſneſs of Faith, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which the promiſe of Pardon of all our ſins is made through the blood of Chriſt. But Gods Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us or his approving of us to be Righteous in ſuch a ſence, does not make our ſins to become no ſins, nor is it I conceive Gods Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act; but yet it is that which doth <hi>judicially qualifie</hi> us for Pardon, and which as it were opens the door and lets us into the poſſeſſion of it. For Pardon is the next and immediate act, that in order fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Gods adjudging us to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition on which he promiſed us Pardon.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this much of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>judicial Juſtification</hi> and Remiſſion of ſin, it ſeems re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make ſome enquiry into the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56474:118"/>on which ſome ground an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion limiting Juſtification to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin <hi>only.</hi> And thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which above all others ſeem moſt to countenance ſuch an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which are moſt relyed on by thoſe of that perſuaſion are, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. and 4.6, 7. To an enquiry into the meaning of which I will only premiſe this: That if we ſhould find cauſe to think that it may be proved from theſe or any other Scriptures, That we are pardoned by being Juſtified; yet we can have no good reaſon thence to conclude that we are Juſtified <hi>only</hi> by being. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; no nor yet in the propereſt ſenſe neither, when we conſider how expreſs the Scriptures are elſewhere for a judicial Juſtification, to wit, Gods Juſtifying us by Faith and by accounting or adjudging Faith to us for Righteouſneſs or for a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the terms of the Goſpel; our conformity whereto is as truly our Evangelical Righteouſneſs, as our conformity to the terms of the Law
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56474:118"/>would have been a legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it had been found in us.</p>
               <p>To begin now with <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. the words are theſe, <hi>And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>To be Juſtified from ſin, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſignifies to be freed from the power and dominion of it. Thus in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid in Verſe 6. <hi>Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> adds in <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. for he that is dead <hi>is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from ſin.</hi> For ſo it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the marginal reading; and ſo the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tranſlation <hi>Engliſhed</hi> reads it; though in our Tranſlation it is rendred <hi>freed,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> from ſin. And in this ſenſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> underſtood this <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. as I find him quoted. And to this ſence of the word Juſtifie, agrees the reading of <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. which ſome upon occaſion uſe. Let him that is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56474:119"/>filthy be filthy ſtill: and he that is Righteous, let him be <hi>Juſtified</hi> ſtill. To the ſame ſence of the word Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, ſome alledg <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. compared with <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are</hi> Juſtified <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> Where Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to be aſcribed unto the Spirit of God in one reſpect, as to the Lord Jeſus in another. And doubtleſs Juſtification is the effect of the operation of all the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, though the manner of their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be different.</p>
               <p>Now that to be Juſtified from all things from which ye could not be Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> may be underſtood in this ſenſe, there are two things to be ſaid to render it probable. The one is the good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement which this ſence has with other places of Scripture, which ſhew that men are freed from ſin through Chriſt by his Goſpel, ſo as they could not be freed from it by the Law
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56474:119"/>of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus Heb. 7.18, 19. <hi>There is verily a diſannulling of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment going before, for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unprofitableneſs thereof. For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</hi> And again Rom. 8.2, 3, 4. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of ſin and of death. For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> So likewiſe Rom. 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over you: for ye are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> By all which we ſee that the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> could not Juſtifie men from ſin, as Chriſt by the Goſpel-diſpenſation does, if by being Juſtified from ſin we underſtand a being freed from ſin it ſelf as to its dominion.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:56474:120"/>
               <p>The other thing which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to underſtand the words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration in this ſenſe, is what may be obſerved from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid in <hi>Verſe</hi> 38. the words immediately before, <hi>Be it known to you men and brethren, that through this man (Chriſt) is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> Now then if in <hi>Verſe</hi> 39. he ſhould mean no more by being Juſtified, than a being Pardoned, he would ſeem but to ſay over the ſame thing again in other words, which he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is not uſual with him.</p>
               <p>But if this ſhould not be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words: and ſhould we ſuppoſe that by being Juſtified from all things from which they could not be Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould be meant a being Juſtified from the guilt of ſin, as that ſignifies a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from the puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by it; yet let us conſider whether it will neceſſarily follow that the Apoſtle in thoſe words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines Juſtification by Remiſſion of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56474:120"/>ſin; or whether rather he does not thereby only ſet forth the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent benefits that would accrue to them by being Juſtified by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which could not be obtained by their obſerving the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And if ſo, then the meaning would be only this, That by their being Juſtified by their believing, they ſhould be delivered from or ſecured againſt the evil effects of their ſin, from which they could be not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by obſerving the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Now that to be Juſtified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving by vertue of the blood of Chriſt, and to be freed from the puniſhment of ſin, which is Pardon, are two different things, ſeems to be very plain from thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5.9. where he ſaith, <hi>much more than being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> He infers the certainty of their being Pardoned or ſaved from wrath, from their being Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and the inference and that from which it is made, are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56474:121"/>two things. We ſee then that men may be Pardoned by vertue of their being Juſtified, and ſo be <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from ſin,</hi> and yet not Juſtified by their being Pardoned. It will no more follow that becauſe by Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation we are Pardoned, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pardon is our Juſtification, than it will follow, that becauſe by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving we are Pardoned, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Pardon is our believing and our believing our Pardon.</p>
               <p>And now if we ſhould underſtand the words Juſtified from all things from which ye could not be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in both the forementioned ſences, for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered both from the guilt of ſin, and from the power and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, I know no inconvenience in it, both being true. But if we do ſo, yet we do not thereby neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conclude Pardon of ſin to be Juſtification, but only that Pardon of ſin is by Juſtification, as depending upon it. For Gods adjudging of us to have performed the condition in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56474:121"/>believing on which he promiſed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which is his Juſtifying of us, together with his imputing that Faith to us for Righteouſneſs, intervenes, comes between our believing and our being actually Pardoned, and is that which gives the immediate right to it, as I ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid then may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I ſuppoſe, to ſhew that in all probability no ſuch thing can be concluded from thoſe words in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. as that we are Juſtified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pardoned.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture I ſhall enquire into, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. the words theſe. <hi>Not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one or by one offence to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto Juſtification.</hi> That which is firſt neceſſary to be done here, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Tranſlation; becauſe theſe words, the free gift of many offences unto Juſtification, ſeem as we have them in our Tranſlation, a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and ſomwhat unintelligible. I
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56474:122"/>have ſeen the matter in this part of the Verſe Tranſlated from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal thus. <hi>But the free gift is unto Juſtification from many offences,</hi> not <hi>of</hi> many offences. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it thus: <hi>But the mercy was by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of many offences unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Agreeable to this reading is that note of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place in theſe words: <hi>Occaſion being taken from many ſins:</hi> and ſo is that of <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> and <hi>Simplicius,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Occaſion being taken not only from the ſin of</hi> Adam, <hi>but alſo from the proper ſins of all believers.</hi> So that the ſenſe of the place according to this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the words, ſeems to be to this effect. That from the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into which men were fallen, not only by the one offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo by their own many perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal offences, God took occaſion to manifeſt his own Grace and Mercy through Chriſt, to miſerable men, in giving and granting them new terms, by which they might attain unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or a being approved of by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56474:122"/>God as Righteous, their many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces notwithſtanding. And this in Verſe 17. is called <hi>the gift of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> and in Verſe 18. <hi>the free gift unto Juſtification of life, through the Righteouſneſs of one,</hi> to wit, Chriſt. And accordingly the grant which God hath made us of being ſaved by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is ſaid to be <hi>of Grace</hi> and to be the <hi>gift of God. By Grace are ye ſaved, through Faith, and that not of yourſelves: it is the gift of God.</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. Now according to this rendering of the words by all theſe great men of Learning, there is not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch thing as that Juſtification is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin.</p>
               <p>None of thoſe worthy perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned do ſay the free gift is <hi>of</hi> many offences, but all of them ſay it is <hi>from</hi> many offences. So that if we read it thus according to the Tranſlation I firſt mentioned, <hi>the free gift is unto Juſtification from many offences;</hi> the ſenſe will be this, I conceive: That through the free gift,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56474:123"/>we are by Juſtification ſecured from ſuffering the deſert of our many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and is the ſame in ſenſe with the interpretation of <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. laſt ſuggeſted. Where was ſhewed that though Remiſſion of ſin is by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; that is, a benefit accruing to us thereby; yet we cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay that Juſtification is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin. The terms are not convertible: we cannot ſo well ſay that Juſtification is by Remiſſion of ſin, as we can that Remiſſion of ſin is by Juſtification.</p>
               <p>The other Scripture which is much inſiſted on to prove Remiſſion of ſin is Juſtification, or that Juſtification ſtands in Remiſſion of ſin, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Even as</hi> David <hi>alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without works, ſaying, bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.</hi> In which words, as it is argued, Juſtification is deſcribed by Gods forgiving iniquity. But then it is counter-argued, that this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56474:123"/>deſcription by <hi>David,</hi> ſeems <hi>not</hi> to be a deſcription of the Juſtification of the man to whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without works, but a deſcription of his <hi>happy ſtate</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in having his ſins Pardoned. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay even as <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth the Juſtification of the man to whom God imputeth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the Bleſſedneſs of the man. Now the bleſſedneſs of having ſin Pardoned, is a benefit conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans believing, and ſo of his being Juſtified by that belief: for Pardon is promiſed but on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe cannot be the ſame. Which very conſideration, if there were no more, were enough to ſhew that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is not deſcribed by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin.</p>
               <p>It appears at firſt ſight that theſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> were brought to prove ſomwhat ſaid by St. <hi>Paul</hi> a little before. And if they ſhould be brought to prove that Faith is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56474:124"/>counted to a man for Righteouſneſs, which was the thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> had aſſerted in the next precedent Verſe, then they could not be brought to prove that Forgiveneſs of ſin is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for Righteouſneſs; for Faith and Forgiveneſs of ſin, are two different things. By this it appears already, that theſe words of <hi>David</hi> were not alledged to prove Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be by Remiſſion of ſin, as it will further appear by and by.</p>
               <p>To the end then we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand for what purpoſe theſe words of <hi>David</hi> are here recited by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we will conſider his words in the two next precedent Verſes. <hi>Now to him that worketh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of Debt,</hi> Verſe 4. In which words St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have ſtated the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Phariſaical <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt whom he diſputed. They held, as it ſeems, that the reward, to wit, all the benefit, all the happineſs they expected from God, to be due to them as a debt for their obſerving
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56474:124"/>the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They did not expect that their obedience ſhould be accepted or counted to them for Righteouſneſs for the ſake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and upon the account of the Death and Sacrifice of the Meſſias: for they held that he, when he ſhould come, ſhould never die, <hi>John</hi> 12.34. and that therefore their ſin was not to be expiated by the Sacrifice of his death, but by their own legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and that the blood of Bulls and Goats did take away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. and that thoſe Sacrifices with their other legal obſervances were of themſelves their Righteouſneſs, and that upon account hereof, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Life were due to them in the nature of a debt in oppoſition to Grace; and that the Gentiles were ungodly and uncapable of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Juſtification, until they were Proſelytes to their way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls their own Righteouſneſs in oppoſition to that which is of God by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. By all which
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56474:125"/>they rendred the death of Chriſt of none effect, and Juſtification to be of Works and not of Grace, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. and 5.4. In Verſe 5. St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts the contrary, to wit, That <hi>to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> Which aſſertion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> if true, proves the reward to be of Grace and not of Debt, whether by Reward you underſtand only Juſtification, or alſo the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſubſequent to it. For if God count ſuch mens Faith for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which work not, which have no ſuch works as by which to reckon the reward to be of Debt and not of Grace, yea ſuch mens Faith for Righteouſneſs, which had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; then the reward muſt needs be of Grace and not of Debt. This being a ſelf-evident truth, That after a man by ſin hath once made a forfeiture of all to God, whatever good he after receives from him, muſt needs be of Grace. Which made
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56474:125"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, being Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace,</hi> and that too through the redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23.24.</p>
               <p>Theſe words of <hi>David</hi> then in Verſe. 6, 7. ſeem to be alledged by St. <hi>Paul</hi> by way of confirmation of his aforeſaid doctrine, and to prove out of one of the ſacred Books owned by his adverſaries, that their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Anceſtors, ſuch as <hi>David,</hi> whom they could not deny to be Juſtified men, acknowledged themſelves ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſuch as ſtood in need of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſuch as counted it their great happineſs to be Pardoned; and that therefore they could not be looked upon as receiving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Debt, but of Grace. For when he ſays, <hi>even as</hi> David <hi>alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, ſaying, bleſsed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven,</hi> &amp;c. it thereby appears that he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe words of <hi>David</hi> to be fully
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56474:126"/>agreeable to his own doctrine aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Verſe 5. in oppoſition to his adverſaries conceit and opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rewards being reckoned of Debt and not of Grace. And indeed how could St. <hi>Paul</hi> think better to convince them of their error, and to ſhame them out of their conceit of meriting the reward by obſerving the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then by ſhewing them that their famous Anceſtors who obſerved the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as well as any, were yet ſo far from claiming the reward of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as a Debt by way of Merit, that they acknowledged themſelves ſinners, and therefore undeſerving, and counted it their great felicity to be Pardoned through the great mercy and favour of God.</p>
               <p>We will yet conſider this matter a little more particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. The thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts againſt his misbelieving adverſaries, is as I have ſaid, that the reward is of Grace and not of Debt, which he makes out two ways. 1. From the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56474:126"/>
                  <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which is <hi>rewarded.</hi> 2. From the <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>reward</hi> it ſelf. Firſt, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Righteouſneſs that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; and this is deſcribed by the condition or quality of the perſon in whom this Righteouſneſs is found, <hi>he that worketh not;</hi> that is, though it be one that hath not obſerved the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in being Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and the like. And that he means ſuch an one by him that worketh not and yet may be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, appears by the inſtance he gives in <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe, who was Righteous with the Righteouſneſs of Faith, before ever he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Verſe 9, 10. 2. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the nature and property of that Faith which is the Chriſtians Righteouſneſs; it is <hi>a believing in him, that Juſtifieth the ungodly</hi> upon his repentance and belief in the Lord Jeſus. Which very belief contains in the nature of it, a firm perſuaſion that Gods Juſtifying of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt needs be of Grace and not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56474:127"/>of Debt. 3. It is deſcribed by that act of God by which ſuch a Faith becomes a mans Righteouſneſs, and that is by way of <hi>imputation</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <hi>his Faith is counted to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> which argues it to be of Grace and Favour, becauſe he to whom it is ſo imputed, is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſinner ungodly and upon that account cannot merit it. Now then if the Righteouſneſs it ſelf which is rewarded, be of Grace, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that Righteouſneſs muſt needs be of Grace. This we ſee is one way by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be of Grace and not of Debt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the other way is from the nature of the reward of that Righteouſneſs. And this I call ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of proving the reward to be of Grace and not of Debt. For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith Verſe 6. even as <hi>David alſo</hi> deſcribeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that word <hi>alſo,</hi> ſeems to ſignifie an addition of proof of his aſſertion, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>medium.</hi> And this <hi>medium</hi> is taken from the nature of the reward
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56474:127"/>of that Righteouſneſs which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to men in Juſtifying them, as his former was from the nature of the Righteouſneſs it ſelf. And the Apoſtles argument or proof is to this effect. The reward of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by which God Juſtifies men, muſt needs be of Grace and not of Debt, becauſe in great part it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Remiſſion of ſins, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin is an act of Grace in the natural notion of it and in the common ſenſe of mankind.</p>
               <p>And that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> deſign in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this ſaying of <hi>David,</hi> was not to ſhew that Remiſſion of ſin is the Righteouſneſs by which men are Juſtified, but the reward of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the very tenor and purport of his words. For he doth not ſay that <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Juſtification of the man to whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs, as we have cauſe to think he would have done if he had known or thought that Remiſſion of ſin had been mens Righteouſneſs or Juſtification; but he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56474:128"/>ſays, he deſcribes the bleſſedneſs of that man to <hi>whom God imputeth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Now what doth bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Scripture import, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to men, but ſome happineſs vouchſafed them as an effect of Gods Grace, yet ſo as by way of reward alſo of the performance of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Thus, <hi>Bleſsed is the man that feareth the Lord. Bleſſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and the like.</hi> So here, the bleſſedneſs of that man to whom God imputeth Faith for Righteouſneſs, ſeems to ſignifie the happineſs that does accrue to ſuch a man as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that Faith which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Righteouſneſs, or of that Righteouſneſs which is imputed: and the happineſs here ſpecified which does accrue to ſuch a man, is the having his ſins Pardoned.</p>
               <p>Now to underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> here in this ſenſe, does fully agree with his ſcope and deſign in hand, which
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56474:128"/>was to prove the reward to be of Grace and not of Debt. After he had oppoſed the Righteouſneſs of Faith to the Phariſaical <hi>Jews</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by works of the Law; then he ſhews the reward of this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to be of Grace and not of Debt, becauſe it ſtands in Remiſſion of ſin. And whereas he does not uſe the word <hi>reward</hi> here, but the word <hi>bleſſedneſs,</hi> which yet ſignifies the ſame thing, it was probably but to accommodate his ſpeech to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> dialect, whoſe words he recites. And as the ſenſe I have inſiſted on, correſponds fully with the Apoſtles ſcope and deſign here. So it does alſo with the tenor of the Covenant of Grace and the Scriptures elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which promiſe Pardon of ſin on condition of that Faith which is imputed for Righteouſneſs, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it and motive to it.</p>
               <p>And if this ſenſe now repreſented be the ſenſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe Verſes, or much what the ſame (and you ſee what reaſon there is to think
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56474:129"/>it is) then his intent here was not to ſhew that we are Juſtified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pardoned: he does not ſay it is Pardon of ſin which is imputed for Righteouſneſs, but <hi>Faith:</hi> Nor does he ſay that <hi>David</hi> deſcribes the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Juſtified man in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are Forgiven, but the bleſſedneſs of that man, or the reward of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And by this time I am thinking, much more need not be ſaid touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Remiſſion of ſin, nor to ſhow that Juſtification does not ſtand only in Remiſſion of ſin. For whatever is the right in this matter, there is the leſs need of contending about it, ſince thoſe who place Juſtification in Remiſſion of ſin, do hold an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual operative Faith, the neceſſary condition of obtaining it, as well as they do, who place Juſtification in the Righteouſneſs of Faith. The one placeth the matter of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the performance of the ſame
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56474:129"/>condition neceſſary to Juſtification; upon which performance the greateſt ſtreſs is to be laid in this matter: becauſe thoſe who perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe of the Goſpel, ſhall be ſure to be Juſtified, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their judgment about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Juſtification be right or no: whereas without this performance they cannot, though their notion of the nature of Juſtification ſhould be never ſo orthodox and ſound. But although the difference ſeems to be of no great moment, yet in as much as there is Divine Wiſdom in fitting means to ends, and in appointing ſuch or ſuch a thing to ſuch an uſe and not to another or rather than to another; and that thoſe which he hath pitch'd upon, are in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or other better for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than any we can ſubſtitute in their room; it follows then that if God hath placed the matter of our Juſtification in the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, rather than in Remiſſion of ſin, that then we ſhould
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56474:130"/>not confine it to Remiſſion of ſin only.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak plainly, I cannot think it a matter of ſuch indifferency whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we hold Remiſſion of ſin our only Juſtification, or Gods adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us Righteous upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, but that it is well worthy our beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find out which of theſe opinions hath the Holy Scripture on its ſide, if it were but for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if there were no more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The notion of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Faith, is a more ready and more effectual way to detect the opinion of error and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, which placeth Juſtification in the imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to us in it ſelf and not only in its effects, than the notion of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Remiſſion of ſin is. For ſo long as the Scripture doth ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and expreſly teſtifie as it does, that it is <hi>a</hi> Righteouſneſs by which we are Juſtified, it is nothing ſo eaſie to ſatisfie the reaſon of mens minds, either from the Scripture or from
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56474:130"/>the nature of the thing it ſelf, why Remiſſion of ſin ſhould be ſtiled our Righteouſneſs rather than the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us; as it is to convince them that neither the one nor the other is in Scripture ſtiled our Righteouſneſs in their ſenſe, but that it is the Righteouſneſs of Faith that is ſo ſtiled there. While the queſtion is only, which is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us for Righteouſneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, in the ſenſe uſually oppoſed, or Remiſſion of ſin; the competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing ſo unequal in reſpect of evidence from Scripture and from the nature of the thing, as it is when the queſtion is, whether the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, or the Righteouſneſs of Faith by virtue of his Righteouſneſs, is counted to us for Righteouſneſs; becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is expreſs for this, but not for either of the other. Let this then be but once well proved, that it is Faith it ſelf, as the principle of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs, that is the thing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56474:131"/>which is imputed to us for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that it is by it that God Juſtifies us; and the opinion of being Juſtified by the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs in the ſenſe uſually impugned, will ſoon fall to the ground. If the former notion be but well ſeated in the mind, the later will of it ſelf fall out of it.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then the dubiouſneſs of both the foreſaid opinions, there is the leſs reaſon to wonder that the controverſie ſhould continue ſo long as it hath done, between thoſe who place Juſtification in the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and thoſe who place it only in Remiſſion of ſin. For although the reaſonings are (as I think) unanſwerable which the one uſe againſt placing Juſtification in the imputation of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the ſenſe in which they oppoſe it: yet while their arguings have not perhaps been ſo irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for placing it in Remiſſion of ſin, it hath doubtleſs made the other the more tenacious in their opinion,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56474:131"/>unleſs they could ſee better ground for that opinion which has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them in exchange for theirs, than hath been tendered them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had Juſtification been placed in the Righteouſneſs of Faith and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, inſtead of being placed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin: and had thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures been duly opened and applied, by which it may with great ſtrength and clear evidence be proved, that it is Faith or the obedience of Faith which is imputed to us for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by which we are Juſtified by God; the controverſie would have been managed with greater advantage for the convincing of thoſe of oppoſite opinion, than it hath been by aſſerting that we are Juſtified by being Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; and would ſooner have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them in all probability, to have exchanged their own notion of the Righteouſneſs of Juſtification, for this. And the reaſon hereof is this; becauſe the Scripture is expreſs and plain for this, whereas ſo far as I can find, there is no one Text in all
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56474:132"/>the Bible, that doth expreſly affirm that Pardon of ſin is our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or that it is counted to us for ſuch, no more than there is that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is in it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us for Righteouſneſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and not only vertually made ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides all this, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether the doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imputation of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith to Juſtification, does not tend more and more directly to work in mens minds a ſenſe of the neceſſity of a perſonal inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in order to their being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of as Righteous, than that does which teacheth that men are made or accounted Righteous when Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by having their Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forgiven. For there ſeems to be more occaſion and room left by the one notion than by the other, for ſuch as have a mind to be happy without being truly Righteous, to hope that they may be ſo. For when they apprehend that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Righteous by having their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56474:132"/>Pardoned, they will probably be more apt and prone to preſume through the abundant mercy of God to be made or accounted Righteous this way upon their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Faith, though not truly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Righteous, then they would or could be, were they but convinced that nothing leſs will paſs for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the account of God in Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, then that which is real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal inherent Righteouſneſs indeed.</p>
               <p>We find in Scripture how apt and ready men have been, to hope to be Juſtified and Saved by Faith without works or inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, upon the account of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative or notional Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. Aagainſt which deceitful notion St. <hi>John</hi> alſo warned the Chriſtians, when he ſaid, <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.7. as if he ſhould have ſaid, you will be deceived if you ſuffer yourſelves to be perſuaded to think you may be Righteous any other way, without
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56474:133"/>doing Righteouſneſs. Thoſe deluded people it's probable, were willing to interpret the doctrine concerning Faith when but generally and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely expreſt, to a ſenſe which would indulge them in a life not truly holy; as alas too many do at this day, who upon a general inoperate belief of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, doubt not but they ſhall be Juſtified by being Pardoned, or by having Chriſts Righteouſneſs ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them as to be Righteous with his Righteouſneſs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be told that ſuch a Faith as works by love, is neceſſary to their Juſtification as a condition of it, yet ſo long as Juſtification is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by that which is eſteemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically eſſential to Juſtification, without ſuch a Righteouſneſs of Faith; and ſo long as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend there is a way of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Righteous by being Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; they will not ſo eaſily, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would, be brought to a due ſenſe of the neceſſity of a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56474:133"/>inherent Righteouſneſs unto Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Whereas were they but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that God will account none Righteous upon any account whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nor Pardon their Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who are not Righteous indeed with a perſonal inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they would be left without all hope of being Righteous or of being accepted as Righteous any way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this inherent Righteouſneſs. And by this means they would come under a more ſenſible obligation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming inherently Righteous indeed, as ever they hope to be Juſtified as Righteous in one reſpect, or Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as ſinners in another. And it is a good rule, that in all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about points of Chriſtian doctrine which have an influence on practice, as all generally have, it is ſtill ſafeſt to adhere to that ſenſe which moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges men to their duty, and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and indubitably tends to their happineſs; as this touching Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Righteouſneſs of Faith, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by Remiſſion of ſin, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive does.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:56474:134"/>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover to place Juſtification in Pardon, diſagrees to the natural notion which men have both of Pardon and Juſtification. Pardon in the natural notion of it ſuppoſeth guilt: as on the contrary, Juſtification in the natural notion of it, ſuppoſeth Guiltleſneſs or Righteouſneſs in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the matter or cauſe wherein a perſon is Juſtified; unleſs when the word Juſtification is uſed in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive ſeuſe to ſignifie the perverting of juſtice by Juſtifying the wicked. To ſay a perſon is Juſtified when we thereby only mean that he is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, gives an uncertain ſound in common ſenſe, and Miniſters occaſion for the notion of Juſtification to lie uneven and to remain unfixt in the mind. What I recited out of Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in my firſt Chapter, may here again be remembred; who ſaith, <hi>To Juſtifie is not to Pardon; for the word is never found ſo uſed, either in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>or</hi> Greek <hi>writers, ſacred or prophane, nor in our common ſpeech.</hi> And if ſo, why ſhould it be made
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56474:134"/>uſe of to ſignifie Pardon, contrary to the uſe not only of Prophane but of Sacred Authors, and common ſpeech? Nor can I conceive upon ſuppoſition of the truth of Mr. <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s aſſertion, but to uſe the word Juſtification to ſignifie Pardon, or the word Pardon to ſignifie that thing which is Juſtification, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the true notion of Juſtification to the minds of men with diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as tending to obſcure it, if not to drown the proper notion of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Furthermore, to place Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Remiſſion of ſin, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found things of quite a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for ſo Juſtification and Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, I conceive, are. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of a mans Juſtification, is his Righteouſneſs; but the ſubject matter of his Pardon, is his Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. The ſubject matter of a mans Juſtification, is his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the terms of the Law of Grace; but the ſubject matter of his Pardon, is his paſt nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that Law and what other
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56474:135"/>Law of God ſoever he hath tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It alſo confounds Gods Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying act and his Pardoning act, as if they were both one. Nay more then ſo, it excludes that which is moſt properly Gods Juſtifying act, and introduceth his Pardoning act in the room of it. For it ſuppoſeth God to account or to make a man Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by pardoning his Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſtead of his adjudging him Righteous in that he hath performed the terms of the Goſpel, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which he promiſed him Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, the notion of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Remiſſion of ſin, does not, ſo far as I can ſee upon the moſt ſerious conſideration, at all agree with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtated notion of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juſtification, in oppoſition to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> notion of Juſtification by the Law or works of the Law. For he doth not repreſent the difference of the notion of Juſtification which he aſſerts, and that which he oppoſeth, to lie in this, that the one ſtands in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56474:135"/>a pretended Righteouſneſs, and the other in the Pardon of mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, but in the different kinds of Righteouſneſs, the one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Righteouſneſs of Faith or by Faith, the other in the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law or by the works of the Law. <hi>The Gentiles,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which followed not after Righteouſneſs, have attained unto Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith.</hi> There is the Chriſtian Juſtification. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs, wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law:</hi> and there is the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Rom. 9.30, 31, 32. <hi>Not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not Juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2.16. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal difference we ſee which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes between the two notions of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56474:136"/>Juſtification, lies in the different kinds of Righteouſneſs. The Chriſtian or Evangelical Righteouſneſs conſiſting in a belief of and obedience to the doctrine and precepts of the Goſpel, but the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Righteouſneſs as they conceited in their conformity to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> both held Juſtification to be by <hi>a</hi> Righteouſneſs. Now to ſay we are Juſtified by being Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, does not at all agree with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> notion of being Juſtified by an Evangelical Righteouſneſs of Faith: becauſe Pardon of ſin is no ſuch Righteouſneſs: it is neither a believing of the Goſpel, nor act of obedience to it; but is part of the reward promiſed to ſuch a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And as ſuch it is ſomtime al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged indeed to prove Juſtification by Faith to be of Grace and not of debt, as I have ſhewed from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. but never throughout the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſtiled Righteouſneſs, that ever I could find. And if any think it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in ſuch Scriptures where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56474:136"/>of Righteouſneſs is ſtiled Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by a Figure; yet if it ſhould be ſo, it would no more prove Remiſſion of ſin to be Juſtification, than it will prove Glorification to be Juſtification; which yet in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account is quite different from it. For he ſays, <hi>Whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30.</p>
               <p>And now for theſe reaſons I hope it will not be thought unneceſſary nor unprofitable to have endeavoured to ſhew that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſin: however what hath been done herein is ſubmitted to the conſideration and judgment of the judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>But there is another opinion which I but now mentioned of worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as I apprehend it, of which I have ſaid but little. And that is the opinion of thoſe who place our Juſtification in the imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to us; not only in its <hi>effects</hi> as we all hold, but <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> as if it were ſo transferred to us, that we were Righteous with the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56474:137"/>very ſame perſonal and numerical Righteouſneſs wherewith he himſelf is Righteous, and that it is ſo reckoned ours, as if we had wrought it in our own perſons; yea that indeed we have wrought it in and by him. The nakedneſs of which opinion hath been plentifully expoſed by others; and I ſhall not concern my ſelf with it now further than what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done in theſe papers. Wherein I have ſhewed that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt operates to our Juſtification, in quite another way: And likewiſe that it is the Chriſtian Faith as ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and practical, that is imputed to us for Righteouſneſs, and that by virtue of Chriſts Righteouſneſs and Gods act of Grace upon the account of it. But then this, which yet is the plain doctrine of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is quite another thing than the transferring of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs it ſelf to us.</p>
               <p>Indeed, this opinion excludes and ſhoulders out the Chriſtian Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Righteouſneſs, from the office
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56474:137"/>and uſe to which God hath deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and is attended with ſeveral dangerous conſequences and abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties otherwiſe, as hath been ſet forth at large in ſeveral Books which treat of this ſubject, which I ſhall forbear to repeat. For my deſign in theſe papers, was not to treat of Juſtification in a way of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, nor ſo much to detect what is to be avoided, as what is to be imbraced and held faſt in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For I reckon, that if that which is the truth be received into the mind upon ſatisfactory grounds, that which is its contrary, will fall off of it ſelf.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>WE have now ſeen how much hath been done by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father and his Holy Son our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, that we might be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Pardoned and Glorified: all things on their part are prepared
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56474:138"/>and made ready. The Father hath made and the Son hath fulfilled the Law of Mediation, to bring about a Reconciliation between an offended God and us Rebel-Creatures. Chriſt hath now no more ſorrows nor pains, nor deaths to undergo and ſuffer for us. There are no <hi>terms</hi> of Grace and Mercy, of Pardon and Peace, of deliverance from Hell and of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glory of Heaven, which are not already obtained for us, and by the Goſpel plainly made known and freely offered to us.</p>
               <p>For it is, as I have ſhew'd, of Grace in God and obtained by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that Faith or the Righteouſneſs by Faith is made the condition of Pardon of ſin and eternal Life, as well as the conferring of Pardon and Life is, on that condition.</p>
               <p>Since then ſuch terms of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are obtained for us; it remains on our part that we receive not this Grace of God in vain, but that we be as careful to obſerve thoſe terms,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56474:138"/>as we are deſirous to enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits annexed to them; becauſe we cannot enjoy the one without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the other. We cannot enjoy the benefits of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> but by becoming <hi>new creatures</hi> and by living <hi>new lives.</hi> For this is the <hi>new</hi> Righteouſneſs by Faith, on condition of which the great promiſes of the <hi>new Covenant</hi> are made. Whoever will come to the <hi>Wedding Supper of the Lamb,</hi> muſt come in his <hi>Wedding garment,</hi> or elſe he will be excluded. And the Wedding garment in which the Bride the Lambs Wife is ſaid to be arayed, is ſaid to be <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Saints,</hi> Revel. 19.8. And now Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for us, we muſt keep the Feaſt on this Sacrifice, not with the old leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of <hi>ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth,</hi> which is the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Righteouſneſs I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much of. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Old things are paſt away now, and behold all things are become new.</hi> Our
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56474:139"/>old Righteouſneſs in which man was firſt made, is loſt, and a new Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs inſtituted. In the room of the old terms of happineſs, perfect innocency, now the new ones of Faith and godly Sincerity are introduced. This new and living way into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is now conſecrated for us through the fleſh and blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Nothing but a <hi>new man,</hi> a new heart, a new ſpirit and newneſs of life, will correſpond or ſuit with the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> nor with <hi>the new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which is above. Theſe are all of one piece, there is no parting of them, nor having an intereſt in the one, without having the other.</p>
               <p>And now conſidering that all this happineſs of Pardon of ſin and the Glory to come, and the terms of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining both, is brought about only by the Grace of our God and the Mediatorial Righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; what can we do leſs than to joyn with thoſe Redeemed of the Lord mentioned in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. who are ſaid to have ſung a <hi>new ſong</hi> to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56474:139"/>the everlaſting honor of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Book and to open the Seals thereof: for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt Redeemed us to God by thy bloud, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and haſt made us unto our God kings and prieſts.</hi> How much more cauſe have we to ſound forth the praiſes of the Redeemer of the World, than thoſe Myriads of Holy Angels, which have no ſuch need of a Saviour as we have?

               </p>
               <p>And well may we with thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits ſing aloud of the riches, wiſdom, and ſtrength of the Lamb that was ſlain, as moſt worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe, becauſe he uſeth them
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56474:140"/>to ſo worthy a purpoſe as to lift up a miſerable world that was caſt down and laid very low indeed. He certainly is moſt worthy of his unſearchable riches, ſince ſuch is his goodneſs as that he was not content to be happy alone, nor to ſee us lie in poverty and miſery, ſo long as he was able to relieve us and make us happy with his riches, but rather than he would be wanting in this, he choſe for ſome time in ſome ſort to empty himſelf to fill us. <hi>Ye know,</hi> ſaith <hi>St.</hi> Paul, <hi>the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. This is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men indeed, nor was it in the power of Angels: and therefore his Glory is to be exalted above the earth and heavens, and both made to ring with joyful acclamations and praiſes of and to our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>And it is very obſervable that thoſe in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. who are ſaid to have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56474:140"/>
                  <hi>ſung a new ſong before the throne,</hi> are deſcribed by the Virginity of their Chriſtianity, as not being prevailed upon by any temptations whatſoever, to be unfaithful to Chriſt, but are ſaid to be ſuch as <hi>do follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, and in whoſe mouths is found no guile;</hi> ſtill deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſincerity by which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Righteouſneſs hath been deſcribed. And it's further obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo, that it's ſaid there, that <hi>no man could learn this new ſong, but thoſe which are Redeemed from the earth.</hi> And the reaſon is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who moſtly and chiefly mind earthly things, and ſet their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon them (as thoſe which are not Redeemed from the earth do) neither have nor can have ſuch a grateful ſenſe of that ſtupendious raviſhing and tranſporting love and goodneſs of our bleſſed Redeemer, in what he hath done and ſuffered for us, as is requiſite to qualifie them to ſound forth his praiſes with that feeling and affection, which the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56474:141"/>Redeemed of the Lord do. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath told us, that the cares of this world, the deceitfulneſs of riches and the luſts and pleaſures of other things; choke the word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo hinder its operation. Though men hear it and profeſs it, yet the great ſenſe which too many ſuch have of theſe preſent things, ſtifles their ſenſe of Spiritual, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abſent things, ſo that they prevail not upon them to work any ſuch deep ſenſe in them of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd love and goodneſs of our Saviour, in procuring theſe things for us, as they do upon them who have learned to ſing that new ſong. Theſe that are Unredeemed from the earth, they ſavour the things of the fleſh and of the world, more than the things which be of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot ſing this new Song with Grace in their hearts to him.</p>
               <p>None then we ſee but <hi>new Covenant men,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>renewed in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their minds,</hi> can learn this <hi>new ſong:</hi> they are a peculiar ſort of men
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56474:141"/>and women, a choice or choſen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that can ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvelous light. Thoſe whom the Lamb that was ſlain hath Redeemed from Hell by his own bloud, are ſuch who are firſt Redeemed from the earth; both from the earthly minds, and evil manners of men of the earth whoſe portion is only in this life.</p>
               <p>This bleſſed Redeemer whoſe high praiſes ſhould be in our mouths, is the Lord from Heaven, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid: and they muſt be of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly extraction and born from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that can skill of the manner of his Kingdom and Government, and of the nature of the work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that people. The diſcourſe of things proper to that ſpiritual ſtate, is to mere natural men almoſt like ſpeaking to them in a language they do not underſtand. Hence when <hi>Nicodemus</hi> heard our Saviour diſcourſe of the neceſſity of being
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56474:142"/>born again or from above, his thoughts ran of a mans entering a ſecond time into his mothers womb to be born again. The things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to the natural man, are fooliſhneſs; ſo far is he alienated from the life of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. And the Scripture ſpeaks of the ſons of God, ſuch as are born from above, as of perſons whom the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. All this ſtill ſhews how abſolutely neceſſary it is in order to our learning the new ſong which is ſung before the throne to the honour of the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world, that we become new men, endued with new principles of living, and with a new Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And by being ſo, we ſhall not only be qualified to offer ſpiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of thankſgiving, acceptable to our Saviour and to the Father by him, but we ſhall thereby alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to the world as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely; which is the greateſt honour we can do him. For the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56474:142"/>
                  <hi>new man</hi> is created after his likeneſs, in purity, humility and charity; in univerſal Righteouſneſs, Gentleneſs, and Goodneſs, in which reſpect the followers of Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of a Divine nature,</hi> and to have <hi>put on Chriſt.</hi> And when men ſee that his Diſciples become ſuch by following his doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; this redounds to the honour of their maſter from whom they learned it, and greatly tends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile mens thoughts and affections to him and to his Religion. And thus they help forward his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (on which he ſet his heart) of recovering thoſe that were run from God and goodneſs and from their own happineſs; than in doing which we cannot gratifie him more or pleaſe him better. By becoming ſuch and by being in the world as he was in the world, we ſhall ſhew forth the vertues of our Lord, and what is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable and praiſe-worthy in him: In reſpect whereof, his followers are ſaid to be the glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:56474:143"/>
               <p>And if we have any mind to make our bleſſed Saviour any other return of that ſtupendious Love which he hath expreſt towards us, beſides ſongs of praiſe and thankſgiving to the honour of his name, he hath told us how we may do it to his great ſatisfaction, when he ſaid, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> John 14.15. As if he ſhould have ſaid, if ye would expreſs the grateful ſenſe of my love to you by expreſſions of yours to me, then keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. For ſaith he again, <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you</hi> (John 15.14.) <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, he it is that loveth me</hi> (Ver. 21.) Our doing his Commandments tends to the full accompliſhment of his deſign of reconciling God and us, and ſo of making us happy. For unleſs we keep his Commandments, we cannot be reconciled to God, and conſequently God will not be reconciled to us. So that if we will not keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, we fruſtrate and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56474:143"/>him of his deſign of good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and render all his ſore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to bring this to paſs, to be in vain and of none effect in reference to us, which muſt needs much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him. But on the contrary, if we do keep his Commandments, then he has the end of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial undertaking, which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling God to us and us to God, which cannot but be matter of high ſatisfaction and pleaſure to him, then in contributing towards which, we can no way better gratifie him for all the love he hath ſhewed us.</p>
               <p>And among all the things which he hath Commanded us, there is one which he hath ſignalized for his Commandment in ſpecial, as that on which he hath much ſet his heart, which he expreſſeth in theſe words: <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> John 13.34. In doing of which we ſhall write after his copy, and ſhew the world whoſe Diſciples we
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56474:144"/>are, and by whom we have been taught. For <hi>by this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another,</hi> Ver. 35.</p>
               <p>And we do in ſome poor meaſure love one another as he hath loved us, when we put on bowels of mercy and kindneſs towards one another; for ſo did he towards us when he put on our nature and ſuffered for us in it. And ſo we do alſo when we bear one anothers burdens and ſo fulfil this Law of Chriſt. For he was touched with the feeling of our infirmities: he himſelf took on him our infirmities and bore our ſickneſſes, as the Scripture ſpeaks. And ſo we do likewiſe when we prefer the publick good the good of many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our own eaſe and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, like St. <hi>Paul</hi> who ſought not his own profit, as he ſays, but the profit of many that they might be ſaved. For thus our Saviour loved us, when he expoſed himſelf to the ſoreſt ſufferings for the publick good of mankind. And becauſe he thus
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56474:144"/>laid down his life for us, <hi>therefore we alſo ought to lay down our lives for the brethren,</hi> when the intereſt and publick concern of the Church of God calls for it. And ſo we do in like manner love one another as he hath loved us, when we uſe our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, riches, and power to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happy as well as our ſelves. For ſo hath our bleſſed Saviour uſed his to make us happy: Yea he made himſelf poor that we through his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty might be made rich. Indeed there is ſo much of that in this love which enabled our bleſſed Saviour to do and ſuffer ſo wonderfully for us, for our good and benefit as he did, that in nothing we draw more near him, nor in any thing make our ſelves more like him; nor can we in any thing more pleaſe him, than in loving another, as he hath loved us. In ſo much as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 John 4.16.</p>
               <p>And if we love one another as he hath loved us, we ſhall not only reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56474:145"/>him in the act of love and doing good, but alſo in the pleaſure and ſatisfaction which he took and does take in loving us and doing us good as he hath done; and ſo ſhall in ſome ſort <hi>enter into our maſters joy,</hi> now for the preſent, by ſharing with him in the joy of doing good. As for our bleſſed Saviour, the proſpect which he had of how much good he ſhould procure and do for a poor miſerable undone world, by the ſhame and pain which he ſuffered for us, and the ſatisfaction and joy that would accrue to him thereby, was that which in a great meaſure carryed him through thoſe unparallel'd ſufferings which he underwent for us. <hi>He for the joy that was ſet before him endured the Croſs and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12.2. The joy that was ſet before him, was not only his own glorious exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the reward of his ſufferings, but alſo the deliverance and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he ſhould procure for all the Redeemed of the Lord. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this joy and pleaſure, and the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56474:145"/>high content and ſatisfaction which does accrue to our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon the account of the good the world receives by what he hath done, ſuffered and does do for it, the Prophet ſpake by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, when he ſaid, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. What other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive do we think has the Almighty God and Father of all, to fill Heaven and Earth with his goodneſs, and to commiſerate a loſt world, and to raiſe up the Tabernacle of <hi>Adam</hi> that was fallen, but the pleaſure he takes in his love, and in doing good? <hi>He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth iniquity and paſſeth by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the remnant of his heritage,</hi> and why? But <hi>becauſe he delighteth in mercy. He exerciſeth loving kindneſs, Judgment and Righteouſneſs in the earth,</hi> and why? <hi>For in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.24.</p>
               <p>And moſt certain it is that if we love one another as Chriſt hath loved us, if we are thus partakers of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and are of the ſpirit and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56474:146"/>temper of Chriſt, and in that ſenſe have put on Chriſt; if we do good to others by eaſing them of their burdens and ſupplying their needs both ſpiritual and temporal, refreſhing and comforting them both in body and mind; and the like, we ſhall not fail of great pleaſure and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of mind in doing thus, but ſhall ſhare with our bleſſed Redeemer in our meaſure, in that joy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which accrues to him in loving us and doing good to us. St. <hi>John</hi> the loving and beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Lord, when once he was ſenſible that he had been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Converting men to Chriſtianity, and of bad to perſuade them to become good, profeſſeth that he <hi>had no greater joy than to ſee his children walking in truth,</hi> 3 Joh. 4. The Scripture ſuppoſeth it as a known and experienced truth, that there is great conſolation in love, when it ſaith, <hi>if there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 2.1. Col. 2.2. There
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56474:146"/>is doubtleſs no ſuch ſolid ſatisfaction in any, no nor in all worldy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as there is in what doth ſpring up to a man from a ſenſe of having done good in his life. <hi>I know, ſaith</hi> Solomon, <hi>there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoyce and do good in his life.</hi> Eccleſ. 3.12. The ſame <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>that a good man is ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> Prov. 14.14. And how comes it to paſs that it is ſo? but from his ſenſe of being good and doing good. <hi>It is a more bleſſed thing,</hi> ſaid our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>to give than to receive.</hi> (Act. 20.35.) and it is ſo, as for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo for this, becauſe the pleaſure of doing good in a good man, is greater than the pleaſure that comes in to another by receiving relief from him.</p>
               <p>If then we would be glad to do ſomwhat that might be grateful to our bleſſed Saviour that hath done ſo much for us: if we would at once both pleaſe him and pleaſure our ſelves with a Chriſt-like, with a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56474:147"/>God-like pleaſure; then it behoves us to be loving one another and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to one another, as he hath loved us and done good to us.</p>
               <p>To conclude all then in a word; as the new Covenant it ſelf is the fruit of our Saviours love to us, ſo the Righteouſneſs of this Covenant on condition of which the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of it, Pardon of ſin and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, are promiſed, conſiſteth in ſuch a Faith as worketh by love to God and our Saviour, and in loving one another as he hath loved us, and by this Righteouſneſs of Faith through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall we be ſure to be Juſtified by God, if it be found in us.</p>
